description: "A (work in progress) community of cool links.This community will eventually be accompanied by a bot to enforce formatting standards, and all links here will be collected and fed to a webpage, where you will be randomly sent to a cool website, based on hashtags and upvotes. Exact details and implementation coming soon.# Usage* Post links and links only.    - If you're posting outside Lemmy and Kbin, the first line of your post should be a link. Put the community mention at the very last line.* All posts must have body text with nothing but a list of **at least** 3 hashtags (space separated, #PascalCase formatted)    - If you have any personal commentary, put that on the comments / replies.* Avoid editorializing titles. Feel free to remove any clutter though.* Upvote / favourite liberally, based on how interesting *you* found a link.    - Not all topics will interest everyone, so please avoid downvoting unless you're doing so on obvious trolls and spam, in which case accompany that downvote with a report.### Linking to the following are prohibited  - Memes  - Current Events & News stories    - Ideally, the links here should be timeless  - Anything with too much politics    - Certain things, such as trans people existing, are not politics. üè≥Ô∏è\u200d‚ößÔ∏è  - Press Releases  - Anything that smells like bigotry    - Yes, this is a safe space    - If this feels like censorship to you, you're welcome to make your own community  - Anything NSFW  - Lemmy communities, Kbin magazines, or other social media accounts    - This rule may be relaxed overtime as the rush of everyone creating their own community dies down, and interesting communities start developing by themselves.    - In the meanwhile, there are better places to advertise your new community.### Linking to the following are allowed with the correct hashtags  - Anything you created, within reason    - Use #SelfPromotion# Recommendations* Prefer links to personal blogs, small communities, and other cooler parts of the net. Avoid blogspam and corporate SEO farming bullshit.* More hashtags the better, as they will be used for filtering when the web UI gets implemented."
