description: "A community for all things physics!I'd like to keep the focus here on physics discussion, so please feel free to come with whatever questions, thoughts, and ideas you may have, however grounded or outlandish they may be! I'm also open to allowing physics comics/humor/memes, but I don't necessarily want that to be the main focus.I'd prefer if we avoided posting pop-sci articles with ridiculous headlines, you know the ones: **New Research Suggests Some Black Holes May Actually be Quantum Tangles in the Fabric of Space-Time**Please don't post that here. If you're not sure about an article, check if the title contains one or more of the following words: *black hole*, *wormhole*, or *quantum - something*. That's normally a good indication that the article might be garbage.Finally, I'm just one dude who's in the middle of writing his thesis, so if you're interested in helping moderate this community please let me know!Remember to follow the usual rules, don't be a dick, etc."
