description: "Welcome to programming.dev's community request zoneIf you have an idea for a community or want to take over an inactive community feel free to make a post here. Posts will be considered by the admins once they hit 7 points## Request Guidelines- Please give both the value for the url and the display name for the community (weve been using snake case for most of the urls)- Communities must fit within the instance as being aimed at topics relevant to software engineers, hackers, hardware and software enthusiasts, script kiddies, cryptographers, researchers, robiticists, and more.- If you have the same idea as someone else upvote their post rather than making a new one just so there isn't duplicates- If requesting an inactive community the mods within the community have to have been inactive for more than two weeks"
