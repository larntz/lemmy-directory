description: "[Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces (UIs) that compiles your code into efficient JavaScript during the build process, resulting in better performance and smaller bundle sizes. Svelte focuses on reactive programming, where UI components update themselves when data changes, eliminating the need for a virtual DOM.[Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev) is an extension of Svelte that adds features like routing and server-side rendering, simplifying the creation of full-stack web applications. It provides file-based routing and supports server-side rendering, enabling faster initial page loads and improved search engine optimization. Svelte Kit combines client-side Svelte components with server-side rendering and serverless functions for a seamless development experience."
