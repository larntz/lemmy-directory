description: "# Welcome to plushies!If you have a plushie friend that makes you happy, please share them here! **Rules:** 1. Take your own pictures — Show us the stuffed friend(s) that *you* took home and love! It's alright if they are a bit worn or if your picture isn't perfect, it's personal, and [to be loved is to be changed!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/538/429/1a2)2. Do not advertise — No portion of the image or the post body should direct or encourage users to purchase a product. If a user specifically requests this information in the comments, you are welcome to provide it as a reply to them. 3. Cute and wholesome — This is not meant to be a graphic or explicit community. If you feel your post would need an NSFW flag for any reason, do *not* post it here. "
