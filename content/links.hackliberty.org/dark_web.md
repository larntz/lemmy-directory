description: "The dark web is a part of the internet where users can access websites without their identities being revealed and with their privacy protected by encryption offered by specialized web browsers like Tor. Since there are many levels of encryption, users can conduct various activities on the dark web that can be legal or illegal.Broadly, the dark web refers to the unregulated part of the internet. No organization, business, or government is in charge of the dark web or is able to enforce rules. This is exactly the reason why the dark web is commonly associated with illegal activities.#### Rules1. Don't do unto others what you don't want done unto you.2. No Porn, Gore, or NSFW content. **Instant Ban.**3. No Spamming, Trolling or Unsolicited Ads. **Instant Ban.**4. Stay on topic in a community. Please reach out to an admin to create a new community."
