description: "Discussion of Japanese light novels and web novels, as well as their associated artwork, anime, manga, fanart and fanfics. Spoilers must be marked, and should almost always include a few words of terse context (such as a volume number) so that one can decide whether to open the spoiler or not. Spoilers are defined as anything in the most recently translated volume and onward (including sources such as prepubs, web novels, anime, family trees, art, side stories, etc).Do not give vague hints about or tease future events, even if you consider it obvious."
