title: "Union of Novelty Subs & Users" 
name: "novelties"
description: "A novelty account is one made for a specific purpose/type of comment. For instance, badwatercolor makes bad watercolor. Their usernames are exactly what they are.A novelty subreddit is easier to define as what it's not. It's not for 'useful/objective topics' like [!worldnews@lemmy.perthchat.org](https://lemmy.perthchat.org/c/worldnews) or science. A great example would be this sub or like [Ask ouija](https://lemmy.perthchat.org/c/ouija). Less good examples are ask lemmy.Can also feature novelty instances, but none exist at the moment nor are forecasted to existed.When you find a novelty account/sub that is not specifically troll/spam related, share it here. The sub should be newish or have some sign of life."
