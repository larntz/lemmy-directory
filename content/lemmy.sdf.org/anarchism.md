title: "Anarchism - No pasar√°n" 
name: "anarchism"
description: "A community dedicated to anarchism. Anarchism is a left-wing political philosophy predicated upon rejecting hierarchy, with many different tendencies and schools of thought. This community is explicitly anti-capitalist; so-called anarcho-capitalists are not welcome here. Individuals holding other non-anarchist leftist views are welcomed to stay, but note that apologia for so-called communist states or their leaders (past and present) may not be received kindly. Liberals are encouraged to stick around (you might learn a thing or two), but should also note that electorally-based solutions are unlikely to given much charity. Mutual aid and direct action get the goods. This community's default language is set to English, but threads in other languages are fine.Community help wanted!"
