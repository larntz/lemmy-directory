name: "houseless"
description: "!houseless@lemmy.sdf.orgWe're not homeless, we're houseless!  By choice or by circumstance we are living in our vehicles.  Don't worry about us -- it can be a very good life. Anything that affects us _as vehicle-dwellers_ is probably on topic.  #  external resources - [emergency guide to suddenly living in a vehicle](https://rvwiki.mousetrap.net/doku.php?id=lifestyle:involuntary) <-- start here if you don't have a choice in the matter - [vanlife FAQ](https://rvwiki.mousetrap.net/doku.php?id=start#faq_for_newbies_and_the_van-curious)- [introduction to power in the vehicle](https://rvwiki.mousetrap.net/doku.php?id=electrical:12v:intro)- [gentle introduction to solar power](https://rvwiki.mousetrap.net/doku.php?id=electrical:solar:gentle_intro)- [overview of charging by alternator](https://rvwiki.mousetrap.net/doku.php?id=electrical:12v:alternator) - guides to [hygiene](https://rvwiki.mousetrap.net/doku.php?id=hygiene:bathing)  and [toilet](https://rvwiki.mousetrap.net/doku.php?id=lifestyle:faq_toilet)#  fedi resources- [vanlife](/c/vanlife@lemmy.world)   - [national parks](/c/nationalparks@lemmy.world)  - [overlanding](/c/overlanding@lemmy.world) - [off_grid](/c/off_grid@lemmy.world)# rules of engagement - be civil - use descriptive thread titles.  Pro tip:  Help or Question are _not_ descriptive titles.   - old-timers:  assume people are different and have different needs, preferences, budgets, and use cases  - newbies:  demonstrate effort and willingness to learn;  you'll need it on the road anyhow.  Links have been added below to help get you started.  When asking question state your use case (what you are trying to accomplish);  we are terrible guessers.   - tire-kickers:  yes, we've heard that in a van down by the river joke.  It was hi-larious in 1993.  -----vandwellers  vandwelling vanlife urbancarliving"
