description: "A place to discuss the meta-aspects of lemmy.sdf.org, so that the SDFpubnix sub can be more useful for announcements and suchlike.Guidelines:- Anything related to lemmy.sdf.org (or other SDF installations, e.g. lemmy.sdfeu.org) on a meta level is fine here.- Discussion of Lemmy, the software, beyond just its SDF installations, is probably better on a non-SDF-specific sub.- Until/unless SDF admins join the sub, consider this a peer-to-peer community (think HELPDESK on the BBOARD.) If you need help from SDF, contact them directly (email membership@sdf is usually the best way.)- **Don't discuss security issues here.** If you've found a vulnerability, email membership@sdf.- Don't panic!"
