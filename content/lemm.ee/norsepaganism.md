name: "norsepaganism"
description: "A community to discuss Norse paganism and other related Germanic neopagan religions (heathenry, Anglo-Saxon paganism, etc). An open and inclusive space.**Rules**1. On-topic. This community is for discussion of Norse paganism and related forms of modern or historical Germanic religion.2. No racism, homophobia, hate. This includes folkism and other forms of racism masquerading as differences of opinion. This space is explicitly inclusive and affirming of different sexualities and identities.3. No trolling, spam, etc. Self-explanatory.4. Proselytizing is not allowed. If your sole goal here is to attempt to convert people to your version of The Truth, you will have problems.5. Neopaganism is not dogmatic. All varieties of belief (theistic, non-theistic, and everything in between) are explicitly allowed here.6. Do not use this community as an advertising platform. Occasional promotion is fine, but don't ONLY use it to promote your wares or services.7. Use common sense. Beyond the above rules, moderation of this community is fairly loose at the moment. Remember you are interacting with other people. Use common sense."
