description: "Intermittent Fasting (IF) is way of eating that restricts *when* you eat, usually on a daily or weekly schedule. People engage in IF to reap the many benefits to health, fitness, and mental clarity. This is a place to share success, support each other, ask questions, and learn. IF is an 18+ community because the practice is not medically recommended to/for children."
