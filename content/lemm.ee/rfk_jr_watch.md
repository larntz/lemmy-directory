description: "RFK Jr. is a right wing, conspiracy pushing, anti-vaccine candidate. He is presently running for the Democratic nomination for presidential candidate. The particular problem with the RFK Jr. candidacy is that he enjoys widespread support due to the Kennedy name and the values that the name has historically supported. The present purpose of this community is to spread awareness of RFK Jr's actual positions and viewpoints in an effort to diminish his utility as a chaos agent and a spoiler in the upcoming election cycle.**Related Communities:**[DebunkThis:](https://lemm.ee/c/debunkthis@lemmy.world) - Debunking since 2010![Skeptic](https://lemm.ee/c/skeptic@lemmy.world) - For looking at the broader world of cranks, quacks, and pseudoscience beyond, but including, RFK Jr![Skeptic Kbin](https://lemm.ee/c/Skeptic@kbin.social) - More of the best of the greatest of Skeptic, now on kbin too!**Resources** [Respectful Insolence](https://www.respectfulinsolence.com/) - Blog by the super secret medical doctor, Orac, who has been debunking RFK Jr.'s medical misinformation since at least 2005![Science Based Medicine](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/) - Detailed posts about various forms of medical misinformation and why they are misinformation.[Skeptical Raptor](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/) - Ancient scaly dinosaur tackles modern medical misinformation.
