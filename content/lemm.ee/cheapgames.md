description: "# Cheap GamesDiscussion about playing games priced $15 or less,Free/Donation-ware is great too!For Piracy there are other communities.Common sources are [Itch.io](itch.io) and  [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/games?device=tablet&hl=en_US&gl=US)## Rules- Be nice- Be honest- Posts are PG-13 ; *The game doesn't have to be*- One game per topic- One topic per game## Creating a PostTry to use the game name as the title.  Try to avoid posting links, but linking in the post content is good.  ## CommentsThe goal is to have one topic per game, and share information and play experiences.  Comments are a good place to link to outside articles, videos, Twitch, etc. *My first time making a Lemmy community; expect things to evolve***___**"
