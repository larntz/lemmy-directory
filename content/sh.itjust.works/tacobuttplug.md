description: "Coming over from reddit... This is my test community in this new decentralized neat thing. TacoButtPlug came about from something amazing they're selling on etsy... But I originally wanted HypnoToad as my Lemmy handle... < /me glares at whoever took it> This community is honestly just going to be a bunch of ramblings from a crazy person whose in school for something medical science related, already worked a career in human rights for a long ass time, been a database slut since early 00s, a cat/dog/squirrel/bird/whatever rescuer, an Angelino, and enjoys an unhealthy level of self-criticism. I am loving this decentralized feel. Reminds me of the old days when the internet was organic and filled with solid irc alliances that would hunt nazi channels down and destroy them with botnets, ddos attacks, and a solid amount of doxing. Because this is literally my first lemmy account it may suddenly go silent. It may not. I am learning fast how this thing works and so far I like this instance. "
