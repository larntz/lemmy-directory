description: "If you're interested in learning Swift/SwiftUI or helping others who are learning, you're in the right place. Courses, questions, problems, projects — they're all welcome here. Tell us what you're been working on lately, why you're interested in learning Swift, or test out what you've learned to use by helping someone else.**Rules**1. Be respectful and patient — remember that not everyone will have the experience or knowledge that you do. We're all here to learn. 2. Keep things relatively Swift-related. Discussion is welcome as long as it stays on topic.3. Self-promotion and sharing paid courses are okay within reason, but if it starts to feel spammy, you may be asked to stop.4. If you're asking for help, please do some basic Googling first and ensure you include context and code so that the people willing to help you have an easier time.**Resources** (This will grow over time, suggestions are welcome.)- https://www.hackingwithswift.com — highly recommended 100-day courses and resources from the incredible Paul Hudson. Free, with paid options for extra support. - https://www.swift.org"
