description: "Information and discussion on gaining lean weight.A good comprehensive source of info is the [Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki)**Quick FAQs***What should my diet look like?*To gain weight, you need to eat more calories than you burn; the more calories you eat per day, the faster you put on weight. Eating this much food ***consistently***, is difficult for almost everyone. Your diet should consist of food: - food that fits your calorie and nutrient goals,- food that you actually like to eat,- food that is easy to prepare to eat- food that you can affordThe idea is to make it easy to eat enough every. single. day. Just like eating a lot won't get you fit if you don't also workout, if you don't eat enough, you might as well not workout. When designing your diet/menu for the week, pick recipes that are tasty, varied, share ingredients, and use ingredients that are on sale. Food that can be meal prepped on Sunday to eat for the rest of the week is ideal.*How much should I eat?***Calories:**The easiest way to find out many calories to eat is to use a TDEE calculator. Some iOS/Android apps, like MyFitnessPal and Cronometer can also calculate your TDEE and help you track and reach your calorie goal.  To gain weight at a measureable pace, a good rule of thumb is to eat 10-25% more calories a day to your TDEE to start.  The bigger your calorie surplus, the more weight you will gain, and after a certain point weight gained will be all fat, so more is not always better (but you do need to eat enough)**Macros:** For weight gain, your priority is to meet your protein goal, and fill the rest with carbs and fat.You should eat generally eat 0.8g of protein per lb of bodyweight.Note that not all proteins are created equal. Some are less bioavailable to humans, or have few amino acids, so you'll need to eat more of it to achieve the same effect.Fiber (and/or vegetables) is important but usually overlooked since it doesn't contain calories. To eat consistently, you want your digestion system working like clockwork - otherwise, you'll find your appetite affected and it'll be harder to eat consistently, which is the overall goal. The more consistently you eat, the more likely your lifestyle changes become habit.**Micros:** When tracking calories, review the previous week for a trend of lack of micronutrients To meet your micros, multivitamins are easy and won't hurt. **NOTE:** Recalibrating TDEE -It's important to readjust your caloric intake as your body gains/loses weight. The easiest way is to recalculate your TDEE for your new weight. A more precise method would be to use the [nSuns Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QTWDxFaB0r-7U6vZmG1s8of7jwd2GHHi/edit#gid=770164572), which adjusts your TDEE based on the rate of change of your own weight data.**Bulking and Cutting**Generally, most lifters are either bulking (trying to gain weight/muscle) or cutting (trying to lose weight/fat). To bulk, eat 1.1-1.25x your TDEE, and lift heavy high volume (lots of sets and reps). To cut, eat 0.75-1x your TDEE, but keeping the same amount of protein, optionally eating low carb, high fat diet.When you bulk and cut is up to you. A rule of thumb is to cut when body fat is at a certain percentage, like 25% for men, or 35% for women.To add:\tMealtimes\t\tMeal Prep\tRecipes\tSupplements\t\tProteinWhat should I lift?\tMental\tMotivating self to go to gym\tWhat should goals beStretchingBalanceStrength standardsHelpful tips (mason jars)"
