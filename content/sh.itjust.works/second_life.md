Do not post content that is illegal in your jurisdiction or might get the instance owner in legal trouble in some other major jurisdiction. Promotion of SL businesses, blogs, Discord servers and similar SL related commercial content is acceptable as long as you do not overdo it with frequency.Second Life is a 3D virtual world where almost all the content is user generated. It has been around since 2002 and publicly since 2003 and has developed significantly since then.Unlike games Second Life and other virtual worlds do not have built-in goals, levels or similar mechanisms. You can think of it more like a place or a platform. Individual locations and groups in Second Life might offer some or all the features a game might have but Second Life (SL) as a whole does not.Second Life has a wide range of ages, countries of origin, languages, interests and professions among its residents and is not limited to the typical gamer.It offers many activities from building, landscaping and decoration over taking pictures and visiting art galleries, attending parties and live concerts, roleplay, travel by and racing a wide variety of vehicles in addition to the built-in teleports, combat both in vehicles and on foot as well as a number of adult activities. And of course you can make great friends and do all of those together.The Second Life servers are often referred to as The Grid of if you want to distinguish the production and preview grids as Agni and Aditi. The OpenSim project is essentially an open source implementation of the server side of SL. There is a [Lemmy Community for OpenSim](/c/opensim@sh.itjust.works)The Second Life client is called a viewer and apart from the official one there is a number of popular third party options.[Second Life Website](https://secondlife.com/)[Second Life Marketplace](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/)[Second Life Maps](https://maps.secondlife.com/)[Second Life Grid Status](https://status.secondlifegrid.net/)[Second Life Wiki](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Main_Page)[Second Life Knowledge Base](https://community.secondlife.com/knowledgebase/english/)[Linden Lab Wiki Page about Official and Third Party Viewers](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Downloads)[Official SL Flickr Group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/secondlifeofficial/)[Grid Survey](http://www.gridsurvey.com/)"
