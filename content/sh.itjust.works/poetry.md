description: "A community for discussion and sharing of poetry.I'll populate this sidebar with more pizzazz as I'm able, but for now let's get this train rolling.- Please be sure to credit all authors- English only? *Non!*- It would be [dope as fuck](https://imgur.com/a/PJGOhbi) if non-English submissions were accompanied by an English translation, though.- Original work enthusiastically welcome! Go ham---I have a hard time imagining an inundation that would require something like OC Thursdays- /r/Poetry chose to allow image submissions so that a poem's formatting can be preserved. We can do the same.- Poetry [memes? ](https://i.imgur.com/aPttqJM.gif)- Spitballing here, but let's try titling memes meme for clarity of scrolling. "
