description: "A community for discussion and sharing of poetry.I'll populate this sidebar with more pizzazz, but for now letâ€™s just get the lights on in here.- Please be sure to credit all authors- English only? *Non!*- It would be [dope as fuck](https://imgur.com/a/PJGOhbi) if non-English submissions were accompanied by an English translation, though.- Poetry [memes? ](https://i.imgur.com/aPttqJM.gif)- Original work enthusiastically welcome! Go ham---I have a hard time imagining an inundation that would require something like OC Thursdays- Image submissions i.e. photos & scans totally welcome- More poetry is good. Be sure to swing by !poetry@lemmy.world"
