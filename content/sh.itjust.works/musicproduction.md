description: "This is Music Production. A place to share anything and everything you want about your music making journey! Learning is the goal, so discussion is encouraged!Check out [waveform.social](https://waveform.social/), a production-centered lemmy instance! We have a community there as well: [!musicproduction@waveform.social](https://waveform.social/c/musicproduction) Here are some useful examples of what would be great to see posted:1. Stuff you made/are making. Get valuable feedback and criticism!2. Learning resources - videos, articles, posts on any topic concerning a production process, be it composition, sound design, sampling, mixing, mastering, DAW workflow or any other.3. Free plugins, presets and samplepacks. Giveaways and self-made stuff included!4. News about production software, releases and personalities.5. Questions and general advice about music production.6. Essays on your favorite productions. Inspirations and insights!**Rules are as follows**: 1. Don't share other people's music without commentary, analysis or questions. This is not a music discovery community.2. No elitism or bigotry towards other people's music tastes. Be polite in disagreement.That's all for now, but I will update them as this place grows.**Good to know:** As a general word of caution, avoid posting complete compositions, mixes and tracks on the internet before backing them up on a remote and reputable server. Even small snippets or watermarked tracks should be posted AFTER backing it up to cloud. Timestamps from cloud services will help you in case of theft. And, as a public resource, lemmy is not a safe space to post your work before it is done and published, so please take necessary precautions."
