description: "This is a place for adult (18+) Lemmy users (lemmings?) to find others with similar interests. Tell us a little about yourself and what kind of lemming(s) you are hoping to find. We also strive to connect people in real life, so if you are seeking a penpal or something similar, this probably is not the place for you.Formatting your posts helps everybody find what they are looking for quickly, so it will be enforced.<YOUR AGE> [<L4L TAG>] #<LOCATION> - <TITLE>- The <L4L TAG> lets lemmings know your gender and that which you are looking for.   * Use either [M]ale or [F]emale based on the anatomy you possess. If you were born with different anatomy than you have currently, add a [T]rans before your current anatomy.   * If you are seeking either [M]ale or [F]emale, use [L]emming.- Your <LOCATION> should be a major city/county you are in or near and any state, province, country, or other information that might help other lemmings know where you are geographically. It is best to avoid local abbreviations or slang.- Some Examples:   * 20 [M4L] #Chicago - Beantown Bowler Looking to Roll With You   * 35 [TF4M] #Paris - Meet for Crepes at the Eiffel Tower and Walk Along the Seine   * 78 [M4F] #Paradise Falls - Roommate Wanted.
