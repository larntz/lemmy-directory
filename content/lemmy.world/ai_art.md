description: "A place to share images and art generated by artificial intelligence and similar tools.**Rules:**- All posts must be relevant to image generation with artificial intelligence.- Please include the name of the AI or tool used to generate your image at beginning of your post to promote searchability. Example: [Midjourney] Picture of a lake.- It's not required, but we encourage you to include the prompt used to generate the image in the description of your post.- To avoid spam, please try to limit yourself to five posts a day. Feel free to add as many images to your posts as you'd like.- Please keep NSFW content to a minimum. Risque content is allowed, but pornographic AI art is not. There are plenty of other places to share that.- Please be nice to your fellow users."
