description: "tech/science swag.----# Guidelines:**What to Submit**On-Topic: Anything that good slackers would find interesting. That includes more than /g/ memes and slacking off. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual laziness.Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably lame.**In Submissions**Please do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points, or saying how great an article is. It should be explicit in submitting something that you think it's important.Please don't submit the original source. If the article is behind a paywall, just post the text. If a video is behind a paywall, post a magnet link.If the title includes the name of the site, please leave that in, because our users lack the intellect to know the difference between a url and a search query.If you submit a video or pdf, please don't warn us by appending [video] or [pdf] to the title. We're not using text-based browsers. We know what videos and pdfs are.Make sure the title contains a gratuitous number or number + adjective. Good clickbait titles are like Top 10 Ways to do X or Don't do these 4 things if you want XOtherwise editorialize. Please don't use the original title, unless you're shits all fucked up.If you're going to post old news (at least 1 year old), please flair it so we can mock you for living under a rock, or don't and we'll mock you anyway.Please don't post on SN to ask or tell us something.

Thanks for the gold, kind stranger, upvotes to the left.# In CommentsBe snarky. Have fun banter. Please don't use big words like fulminate. Please seethe at the rest of the community.Comments should get more enlightened and centrist, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.Please respond to the weakest plausible strawman of what someone says, not a stronger one that's harder to make fun of. Assume that they are bad faith actors.Eschew jailbait. Paedophiles will be thrown in a wood chipper, as pertained by sitewide rules.Please post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. All press is good press.Please use Slacker News for political or ideological battle.

Don't nitpick stupid crap.Please don't be an unfunny chud. Nobody cares about your opinion of X Unrelated Topic in Y Unrelated Thread. You will be banned and reported to administration.Sockpuppet accounts are encouraged, but please don't farm karma.Please use uppercase for emphasis.Please post deranged conspiracy theories about astroturfing, shilling, bots, brigading, foreign agents and the like.
