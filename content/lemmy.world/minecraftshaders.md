description: "A place to discuss everything about Minecraft shader packs and shader mods!Shaders are programs that alter pixel rendering; in Minecraft, they can be used as shader packs, loaded with shader mods, to enhance the game's visuals and provide a better experience.[Here is a list of actively updated shaders](https://wiki.shaderlabs.org/wiki/Shaderpacks); the most popular shaders come from Chocapic13, Sildur, SEUS and BSL, but you are free to download any one that suits your likings/performance the most.**[Optifine](https://optifine.net/)** is a performance optimization mod that additionally allows shader packs to be loaded; it is by far the most widely used mod for loading shaders.**[Iris](https://irisshaders.dev/)** is a shader mod that aims to offer full Optifine shader compatibility, as well as providing additional shader-specific features and performance optimizations. It is not 100% compatible with every Optifine shader pack, but, combined with other performance mods, offers better performance than Optifine.**[Canvas Renderer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer)** is a Fabric shader mod that uses the Canvas API for its shaders and is therefore wholly incompatible with OptiFine shaders. Its purpose is to offer more control and options to mod authors for rendering modded blocks."
