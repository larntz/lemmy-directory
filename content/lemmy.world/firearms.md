description: "A replacement for r/firearms. From the subreddit - Discuss firearms, politics, 2nd amendment news. We value freedom of speech as much as we do the right to keep and bear arms. Posts must be somewhat related to firearms. I removed the ~~must comply with Global Reddit Rules~~, because we don't take nicely to totalitarianism here."
