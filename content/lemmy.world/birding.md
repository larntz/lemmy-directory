description: "A community for people who like birds, birdwatching and birding in general! Feel free to share your photos and other birding-related content here. If a photo you post isn't yours, please credit the original creator! Additionally, it would be appreciated if the location of the sighting and a date were given when a photo or question is posted. You do not have to give the precise location, something like Northern Idaho, June 2023 or even North-Western US, June 2023 suffices. "
