description: "Welcome to /c/LowEndGaming!In this community, we roll our eyes and snicker at minimum system requirements. This is a place where anyone who is struggling to find something to play on an older system can hang out, share or seek tips on how to run that shiny new game on yesteryear's hardware. Found a cool game that runs fantastically on a old/low end system? Do you have a guide for running a newer game below the minimum requirements? Share them!Banner credits go to [/u/draganov505](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/25e6t0/my_really_low_budget_rig_hope_you_like_it/) from Reddit."
