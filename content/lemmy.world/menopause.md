name: "menopause"
description: "**'Menopause isn't really that bad'**...said no woman ever.For those who are approaching or experiencing 'the change' (think reverse puberty), a time where hormone levels decline either through the aging process or by medical/surgical means. **Menopause** and **Perimenopause** (the transitional time before Menopause) are unique to every person, and while there's no one-size fits all, we support each other on this roller coaster ride of wacked out hormones, absurd mood swings and random sweaty hot flashes. *Be kind. Be respectful. We are all in this together!**** **RULES** **1. All genders can post** We are all here to learn about menopause and how to help anyone experiencing menopause, so be supportive and respectful.**2. Don't be a bully, creep, jerk or troll**This means no personal attacks, no misogyny, no misandry, ageism, racism, or otherwise hateful or disrespectful commentary. **3. Read the Wiki (wiki will be included shortly) and use the search tool before posting a new question****4. No selling products or services**You can recommend products/methods that work for you, but soliciting clients or patients is not allowed. No advertising or self-promotions, including using this sub to drive traffic elsewhere.**5. Research surveys/studies are allowed ONLY after contacting the mods with details of the survey** (purpose of survey, academic associations, how will the data be used, privacy/confidentiality policy) Mods will determine whether to approve the post or not.  Those choosing to participate in surveys, must do so at their own risk.**6. No posting lab results**We are not a substitute for medical advice.  Questions about your lab results should be directed to your medical professional.  Hormonal tests are not an accurate diagnosing tool for perimenopause. **7. Selfie posts** are only allowed in the Weekly Stickied Off-Topic thread.  "
