description: "![](https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/2a1ddfe0-8fdc-4c01-9936-8b0ccc07ab7a.jpeg)*A community for Sakura Wars / Taisen fans!***Rules:**- Be careful about making reposts.- Don't downvote posts just because you disagree with them. Downvote posts that don't follow the rules.- Don't steal content you did not make and post it as yours.- Read a linked article before commenting on it.- Upvote good comments and posts. If a post is worth reading or commenting on it probably is worth an upvote.- Avoid being a jerk. Insulting other users almost never leads anywhere good.- Flaming and using foul language is not a nice way to present yourself online.- Be respectful when possible.- Remember that people have different opinions.**Self Promotion:**- You are allowed to share any content (regarding the topic of this community) that you made yourself (such as videos, articles, art...). You can share a maximum of one self-promotion post per week."
