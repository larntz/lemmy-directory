description: "A place for Sounders fans in the Fediverse.  Discussion, analysis, match threads, and more. **Looking for mods, banner images, and new ideas!**## Who are the Sounders - Seattle's MLS team, born in 1974 and in MLS since 2009 - Winners of the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League, 2016 and 2019 MLS Cups, 2014 MLS Supporters Shield, and 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2014 US Open Cups## Community Guidelines*These are some proposed guidelines to get us started, but open to discussion!*- Hot takes and strong opinions go hand in hand with fandom, especially with a supporter community as passionate as the Sounders'. Still: keep it supportive! Remember that players are people and our boys bleed blue and green, even on an off day. Overwhelming negativity is not an attractive look.- Abusive language directed towards anyone - including opposing teams - is not acceptable. Similarly, racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, or other hateful language or content will not be tolerated.    - This community is meant for Sounders-related discussions and content. We welcome fans of all teams to share in these discussions. Trolling or brigading by opposition fan groups, however, will be removed.  Similarly, encouraging the trolling or brigading of other communities is not acceptable.- While most content will be Sounders-focused, we welcome posts & discussion about any Seattle- or Washington-based soccer teams (e.g. OL Reign, Defiance, Ballard FC)## Related Communities- !MLS@lemmy.world- !football@lemmy.worldBanner image credit:  [SoundersBruce on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seattle_Sounders_FC_vs._FC_Dallas_(Oct_19,_2019)_-_ECS_playoffs_tifo.jpg) (License: [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en))"
