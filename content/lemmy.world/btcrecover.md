For seed based recovery, this is primarily useful in situations where you have lost/forgotten parts of your mnemonic, or have made an error transcribing it. (So you are either seeing an empty wallet or gettign an error that your seed is invalid) For wallet password or passphrase recovery, it is primarily useful if you have a reasonable idea about what your password might be.
