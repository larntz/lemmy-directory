description: "All things Pharma! Whether you are in the industry, interested in organic chemistry, or antique pharmaceutical novelties.*Scientific articles are preferred but not required as long as discussion is sparked.***No requests or sourcing for illegal sales/possession or any of that nonsense**Respect for each individual. That means we expect nurses to not post constant complaints about hospital pharmacy and we can't talk about how nurses almost always refuse counsel. Light hearted and silly is encouraged though because pharmacy right now in all forms is absolutely bananas and some reprieve is crucial to mental health.I didn’t think I’d have to say it, but don’t post ridiculous political articles bUt ThINk oF ThE cHilDren rhetoric and scare tactics. This is not the place for grandstanding. Would love to enlist an RPh as a mod so if interested, let me know*___**___*"
