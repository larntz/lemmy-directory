description: "Naming and shaming all recurring spending models where a one-time fee (or none at all) would be appropriate and logical.**Expect use of strong language.**Follow the basic rules of Lemmy and common sense, and try to have fun if possible.No flamewars or attacking other users, unless they're spineless corporate shills.Note that not all subscriptions are awful. Supporting your favorite ~~camgirl~~ creator or Lemmy server on Patreon is fine. An airbag with subscription is irl Idiocracy-level dystopian bullshit.Some other groovy communities for those who wish to own their products, their data and their life:[Right to Repair/Ownership](/c/righttorepair@lemmy.fmhy.ml)[Hedges Development](/c/hdev@lemmy.world) [Privacy](/c/privacy@lemmy.ml) [Privacy Guides](/c/privacyguides@lemmy.one) [DeGoogle Yourself](/c/degoogle@lemmy.ml)[F-Droid](/c/fdroid@lemmy.ml)  Some other useful links: [FreeMediaHeckYeah](https://fmhy.ml) [Louis Rossman's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w)Look at content hosted at Big Tech without most of the nonsense:[Piped](https://piped.kavin.rocks/)[Invidious](https://invidious.io/)[Nitter](https://nitter.net) [Teddit](https://teddit.net)"
