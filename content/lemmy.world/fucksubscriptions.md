title: "Fuck subscriptions" 
name: "fucksubscriptions"
description: "Naming and shaming all recurring spending models where a one-time fee (or none at all) would be appropriate and logical.Follow the basic rules of Lemmy and common sense, and try to have fun if possible.Expect use of strong language.No flamewars or attacking other users, unless they're spineless corporate shills.Note that not all subscriptions are awful. Supporting your favorite ~~camgirl~~ creator or Lemmy server on Patreon is fine. An airbag with subscription is irl Idiocracy-level bullshit."
