Not really the actual movie details, unless they're truly stupid or have strong meme potential/background. Oh hai Mark kind of stuff. Tho sometimes even these can span a good debate.For maximum funni, include full name of the movie, its release date and all the detail right in the title of the post.Try to avoid actual shit and other nasty stuff. Mark nsfw when appropriate.For shitty videogame details, there's [!shittygamedetails@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/shittygamedetails)[Local link](/c/shittygamedetails@lemmy.world)Regular rules of lemmy.world apply.
