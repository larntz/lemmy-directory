description: "Welcome to c/IOTA! -- IOTA is a scalable, decentralized, feeless, modular, open-source distributed ledger protocol that goes 'beyond blockchain' through its core invention of the blockless ‘Tangle’. The IOTA Tangle is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). IOTA is aiming to be the backbone of the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data integrity, micro-/nano- payments, and other cases where a scalable decentralized system adds value."
