description: "This is a locksmith community, meant for actual locksmiths. Non-locksmiths will be tolerated, for now.If you just show up at people's houses and step number 1 is to drill the door lock and then sell them shitty replacement hardware at 1000% markup, go fuck yourself somewhere else.**Rules**1. **No spam**Advertise your trinkets elsewhere. Don't link to locksmith supplier sites either.2. **No lockout questions**Call a local locksmith, we're just little people in your internet box, we likely can't affect your physical location in any meaningful manner.3. **Don't be a dick**4. **Use your brain**Don't post trade secrets. Absolutely no drill points or bitting information. Wouldn't want to aid with thefts and break ins."
