description: "A community dedicated to chronicling and spreading the word about positive actions, solutions, and policies being enacted to try to slow or prevent catastrophic climate collapse. We explore strategies and solutions for solving global warming, mitigating and preventing its deleterious effects, and protecting the environment, animal life and human life from it.Rules:   - Kindness AlwaysNo name-calling, trolling, ad-homs, personal attacks, strawmanning, or disrespectful or abusive behavior toward any other member.   - No BigotryThis should go without saying, but any homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, racism/sexism/any kind of -ism is not allowed. “It’s just a joke” is not an excuse. Any sort of needling to try to convince the mods or anyone else to accept such behavior, or enabling or defending such, is not acceptable either. Breaking this rule will result in a ban on first sight.   - No Spam, NSFW, Or Other Disruptive Content or BehaviorPlease respect our community and don’t use it to post spam, porn, gore, or any other disruptive content.   - On-Topic Only Please, No Doomerism, No Anti-Climate RhetoricAll posts must be evidence of or related to positive actions, policies, and solutions to climate collapse. No doomerism or anti-climate rhetoric allowed; if you think climate change is not man-made or is not really happening, this is not the community for you. This sub is a positive, supportive place and giving into fear and despair over climate collapse is unhelpful and dangerous for people's mental health, so it won't be allowed here. This is humanity's greatest challenge and so we all need to band together and be there for each other as we fix our broken planet.   - English Only PleasePosts and comments must be in English only so they can be properly moderated.*Note: failure to abide by the rules may result in a ban depending on severity.*Rules subject to change based on community need."
