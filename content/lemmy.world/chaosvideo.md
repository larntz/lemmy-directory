It's all stuff I found interesting or informative, or maybe just a little wierd.Intent is for content to be at least mildly interesting and or novel. I'd like to try to stay away from blatantly triggering things. If something is just too good to pass up, (e.g. Smarter Every Day recreating civil war bullets merging) at least tag it as containing a trigger.  trigger e.g. flashing lights, violence, guns, illness, injuryBe Respectful: Treat others with respect and courtesy.
