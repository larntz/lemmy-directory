description: "This community is for discussions about the world, miniatures, and game of 40K.Please share pictures of your painted miniatures, your conversion projects, painting guides, conversion guides, rules questions, rules interpretations, news about local events, news about remote events, house rules, battle reports where your army shines, battle reports where your army is demolished in an entertaining way, guides for winning with your faction, guides for defeating *their* faction, fan fiction... basically, share cool stuff. Err on the side of sharing *more* stuff, and assume we'll find it cool.# Rules:::: spoiler Only in-universe bigotry.Dumping on your least favorite faction is cool (preferably in-character!); racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, ableism (this list is making me sad, and I'm outraged that it is easy to add more), *et cetera*, is ***not***.::: ::: spoiler Attribution is required.If you post your own material, make sure to let us know. You should be proud! If you want to post someone else's material, then at minimum the post needs to include the name of the creator, and where to find the source. Ideally, you post a link to the source so everyone can share, and so that creators have a chance to benefit from their work.:::::: spoiler Think about the person first.A paint job might look like it was executed with a brush clutched between the painter's toes, but maybe it was done by an enthusiastic but inexperienced teen. A kind word before the criticism might make a lifelong fan (or friend!), but a thoughtless comment might send them packing for good. We want *more* people to play with, not fewer.*Ad hominem* attacks, it should go without saying, are uncool.::: ::: spoiler Must be relevant.If it isn't 40K or 40K-universe relevant, please post it! We don't want to stifle anyone's creativity, or discourage communication. Just post it somewhere else.:::"
