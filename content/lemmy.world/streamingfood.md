description: "Streaming FoodSFW/SFL, Links to videos of people preparing or teaching you to prepare food. Carte blanche posts from famous streaming chefs including but not limited to ATTK, BCU, Little old ladies showing you how to make authentic dishes, Famous Chefs, Infamous Chefs, maybe some links to news about shows/movies like The Bear and The Menu. Be Respectful: Treat others with respect and courtesy. No personal attacks, insults, or offensive language. Keep discussions civil and constructive.Obviously every other link here is a food trigger, but let's try to avoid other triggering content as much as possible.  Please tag any likely triggers (e.g. violence, flashing, depression) so that people might know what they're getting themselves into. Avoid excessive self-promotion or spamming the community with advertisements.I'm not against an occasional NSFW for language but it must be clearly tagged. I am not officially affiliated with any of these chefs or their content.  "
