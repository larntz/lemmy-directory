name: "centrist"
description: "Trying to follow /r/centrist, but want to keep it more calm and relaxed, less aggressive conflict.Will leave it casual, be excellent to each other, we all disagree but most of us probably want the best outcome.If specific issues get out of hand we might get sticky posts or something similar, but just try not to go down that road.A zealot is someone who won't change his mind and can't change the subject. There are a lot of really important issues to discuss, please don't try to coerce others into addressing your position. We don't have to have the answers for every question, sometimes we just don't know the right answer yet, sometimes we don't know the right question."
