description: "Welcome to the [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com) community.With the Champions League 22/23 final marking the end of the 22/23 season, I thought it might be a good idea to get a Lemmy community going as a refuge for the diaspora of /r/FantasyPL.This community is currently hosted on the lemmy.world instance because:- It is easy to sign up to- It allows the downvotes- It is not being being hugged to death at the time of writingThere is also a community over at the [feddit.uk](https://feddit.uk/c/fpl) instance but lemmy.world seems to be gaining more traction so we'll see what sticks.You can still subscribe to this instance if you created a Lemmy account on another instance.DM me if you'd like to lend a hand at modding.Keep Rate My Teams to the RMT thread but memes are permitted!"
