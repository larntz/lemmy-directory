It's just a joke is not an excuse. Any sort of needling to try to convince the mods or anyone else to accept such behavior is not acceptable either.3) No Spam, NSFW, Or Other Disruptive Content or BehaviorPlease respect our community and don't use it to post spam, porn, gore, or any other disruptive content. 4) Please Tag All Discussions About The Sub with [Meta]Any meta threads or discussions, suggestions, etc. needs to be tagged with [Meta] in the title, that way it'll be easier for mods to find. If you have any issues with another member or what-have-you, please message a mod.5) Hateful People or Members of Hate Groups Not AllowedNo Nazis, fascists, anti-LGBTQ+ folks, or any member of any groups predisposed to discriminate against or cause trouble for LGBTQ+ people or the community. This includes members of the U.S. right wing. We care about the safety and well-being of our community and that means we won't allow anyone who will threaten or endanger LGBTQ+ people in the sub, and sadly, the U.S. political situation has become volatile enough where a ban of this caliber has become necessary.6) Please Tag Titles Of Sensitive Posts With [TW] or [CW]Please put one of those tags on any post talking about rape, suicide, or self-harm.7) English Only PleasePosts and comments must be in English only so they can be properly moderated.*Note: failure to abide by the rules may result in a ban depending on severity.*Rules subject to change based on community need.
