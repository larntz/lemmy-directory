description: "Ask Europeans questions about their countries!This was one of my favorite subreddits back on Reddit so I'd like to recreate it on Lemmy. If any Mod from Reddit would like to take over this community, I gladly hand it over to them.**Rules**:1. When responding, mention which country are you from since we don't have flairs on Lemmy yet2. Be nice and polite3. No other rules so far, this is a small community so we don't need to make it a police state, we'll see what future brings"
