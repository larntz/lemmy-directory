description: "All things related to the NTT INDYCAR SERIES — the premier open-wheel racing series in the United States — the Indianapolis 500 (Indy 500), INDY NXT, and the USF Pro Championships. ### Moderators needed- The current moderator volunteered because there was no moderator listed and that didn’t seem like a good thing.- He has no idea what he’s doing, but he’s open to input.- He believes a good moderator is a thermostat, not a light switch. The goal is to keep the place comfortable, not dictate what is seen.- He’d really like some help getting this community off the ground.### Rules- Be civil with your words.- Be kind with your intent in saying them.- Always be open to the idea that the person missing the point in any conversation might be you.- It is better to be silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt."
