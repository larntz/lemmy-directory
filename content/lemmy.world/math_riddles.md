It's fun to think about it, and choose when you need a hint!4. **Text & image focus**. The purpose of this community is for its members to try and solve it themselves. Video links are only accepted when they present the question but no solution. If they include a solution, feel free to post the riddle as text and to include a link to your source.___# Code of ConductFor now, code of conduct shall simply follow the official CoC from the Lemmy organization: [Link](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/code_of_conduct.html#:~:text=We%20are%20committed%20to%20providing,nationality%2C%20or%20other%20similar%20characteristic.)Some highlights:* Remarks that violate the Lemmy standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed.
