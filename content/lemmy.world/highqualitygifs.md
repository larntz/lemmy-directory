description: "(Not Open Yet)  This community is for original high-quality gifs and associated help requests. Show off your new gifs, and see what other folks have been working on. Only post gifs that you made yourself.Lemmy doesn't seem to support in-line video formats just yet (.webm, .gifv), post a direct link to a .gif file, let's get back to basics!What constitutes a high-quality gif? High-quality gifs must include: 1. A crisp and clear image.  2. A framerate of at least 25 frames per second (0.04 seconds per frame).  `Note: Frame rates that differ drastically from the original source may be removed. `   3. At least 110,000 pixels (multiply the height x width).  4. No side smaller than 250 pixels.  5. No personal watermarks.  6. No audio.  7. No black bars unless it is a stylized part of the submission (which is basically never).  8. No boxes with text around the gif (meme text). Put your title in the Title box, not on the gif.Mods reserve the right to remove any gif deemed not to be high-quality."
