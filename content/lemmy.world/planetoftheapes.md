description: "Lemmy for Apes — news, analysis, theories, discussion, podcasts and more, including the upcoming Disney era beginning with Wes Ball’s film (2024/TBC). Apes will Rise!Planet of the Apes is an American science fiction media franchise consisting of films, books, television series, comic books, toys, and other media about a world in which humans and intelligent apes clash for control. The franchise is based on French author Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel La Planète des singes, translated into English as Planet of the Apes or Monkey Planet. Its 1968 film adaptation, Planet of the Apes, was a critical and commercial hit, initiating a series of sequels, tie-ins, and derivative works.Four sequels followed the original film from 1970 to 1973: Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes. They did not approach the critical acclaim of the original but were commercially successful, spawning two television series in 1974 and 1975. Plans for a film remake stalled in development hell for over ten years before Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes was released in 2001. A reboot film series commenced in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which was followed by Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014 and War for the Planet of the Apes in 2017.**Rules:**- Be kind to your fellow primates"
