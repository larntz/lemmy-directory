Please follow the main Lemmy.world rules at all times.****2. No brigading/harassment/uncensored usernames, etc.**>All usernames and display names must be censored, unless it's a well known public figure (Tim, Randy, etc.). Well known Epic shills must still be censored.>Do not:>>- Encourage the brigading or trolling of other subs.>- Harass/mass ping Lemmings >- Use racist language.>- Post about getting banned on other subs.**3. No asking for or linking to pirated, copyrighted or otherwise illegal content.**>Please don't report posts/comments simply for saying I'm going to pirate this game. However, any requests or discussion of how or where to get a hold of pirated content will result in a ban.**4. No spam or reposts + limit off topic comments.**>Pro-Epic comments will not mean a ban. Discussion is healthy.>>However, spamming posts will be removed. Reposts will be removed with the exception of a repost becoming the main hub for discussion on that topic.>>Off topic comments that do not pertain to the post at hand may be removed if it is deemed they contribute nothing and/or foster hostility at users. This mostly applies to political and religious debate, but can be applied to other things at the mod's discretion.**5. Post must have Epic explicitly involved**>Allowed posts include but are not limited to a pc game being exclusive to EGS, a pc game not being exclusive to EGS, and official sales numbers and Tweets regarding Epic. A link to a game page is considered advertising.>>Avoid fear mongering or speculative posts until official confirmation of exclusivity.>>Memes or posts about other platforms (Steam, GOG, etc.) can be allowed if they're informative and in good taste.**6. Educate don't attack**>No mocking, demeaning, flamebaiting, purposeful antagonizing, trolling, hateful language, false accusation or allegation, or backseat moderating is allowed. Donâ€™t resort to ad hominem attacks against another user or insult other people, examples of violations would be going after the person rather than the stance they take.>>If we feel the comment is uncalled for we will remove it. Stay civil and there won't be problems.**7. Do not ask for Epic Games support.**>This sub is called Fuck Epic. Most visitors here either don't use Epic store or are already done with it. Therefore, do not ask for or comment providing Epic Games support at any capacity. If a post complains about how bad the Epic launcher or support is, you are allowed to give advice on how to delete their account.>>If you need help either contact the official Epic Games support or ask your question here: [r/EpicGamesPC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC)**8. No Advertising for Epic Games / Store**>Under no circumstance are you allowed to promote or advertise any product or service for Epic Games or the EGS in any way. This includes posting a link to a game page; instead create a discussion where you or some article gives the details of the exclusivity.**9. Flair your posts correctly**>Please flair your post correctly, this is to ensure visitors can use the Filter by Flair option in the sidebar to look for specific topics.>>If you don't know what flair to use or how to set them up [refer to our wiki here](https://archive.is/3Xqm7).>>Posts will be temporarily removed until properly flaired, send us a mod mail with a link and we will approve it.**10. No factually misleading information**>Content that makes claims or implications about Epic that can be proven false or misleading will be removed.>>If instead it's most probably user error e.g. my Epic account got hacked then it will likely be removed as it's misleading you into thinking it's Epic's fault when the user didn't secure their account properly.>>Exceptions may be made for useful discussion; the misleading flair will then be applied.>>This rule does not apply to simple opinions including pro-Epic opinions.---##Related subreddits[r/TimCriticizesTim](https://www.reddit.com/r/TimCriticizesTim)"
