description: "I’m a moderator (/u/MurdoMaclachlan) of /r/TranscribersOfReddit, a now-shuttered project to provide accessibility to blind and visually impaired users. While I as an individual am affiliated with /r/TranscribersOfReddit’s parent 501(c)3 nonprofit organization Grafeas Group, this archive and my transcriptions on Lemmy are not. I just wanted a nice little box to put my transcriptions in for both my purposes and the purposes of blind, visually impaired, and/or low-data Lemmy users.If you would like to also transcribe posts for yourself, head over to the /r/TranscribersOfReddit wiki for some handy guidelines and templates! https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/guidelines/"
