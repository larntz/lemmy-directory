description: "Rules:Job posting/For hire postings only. This sub is not for advice, technical support, etc. There are plenty of other places for that.Agencies are welcome, as long as they don't spam the sub with ads for their company. Any posts not relating to a specific job will be removed and if anyone abuses that, they will be banned. Any posts that are only links to an external site will be removed and if abused will be banned. You are welcome to link to your site for the application process (as text, in the body of the post), but you still must provide the information listed above.Post titles should look like:[ForHire][A][Data Engineer][Tampa, FL/NR][$50k][ForHire] or [Hiring] : Determines if it is a job seeker or a position posting.[A] : Job level. Can be E, A, J, S, Ex, C; Entry, Associate, Junior, Senior, Executive, C-Level. If need be, this can be expanded to accomodate. Entry Level positions should actually be entry level; requiring 3 years of experience and certs for an entry level position means it's not entry level. Entry Level should be reserved for positions require no or very little experience. This will be hard to regulate as everyone seems to have different definitions for individual levels, but here Entry Level will mean no technical experience required.[Data Engineer] : Title of position being offered or looking for.[Tampa, FL/NR] : Location and willingness to relocate (NR = no relocation, R = Open to Relocation, WR = Wants to Relocate, specifically looking for job opportunities outside of home area). Do NOT put remote if the job is not fully remote; clarify in post.[$50k] : Minimum salary requirements or salary range. DO NOT put negotiable, DOE or competitive (unless you include a salary; for example $50K+ DOE). Posts without a salary range or salary requirement will be deleted, no exceptions.[ForHire] postings should include relevant information from your Resume or CV; however, you may state that it is available upon request. Privacy is important; protect yourself. If you do post a resume, please redact PII.[Hiring] postings should include all requirements and expectations. Recruiters like to use a lot of flowery language; I'm not going to censor you, but above all, your post should be informative. It should contain at least:A. Salary (MUST be included)B. Experience RequirementsC. Experience Recommendations (please be honest with these; it will net you better results)D. Cert requirements/recommendations, if any.E. Location, possibility of full/partial remote work, % of travel required.F. Benefits, including but not limited to medical, dental, life, educational reimbursement, certification assistance, etc.G. Employment terms: part-time, full time, contract, contract to hire, etc."
