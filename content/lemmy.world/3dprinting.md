There are several options to help lessen the load on Lemmy instance caching. One option is to join/host a [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) fediverse instance. Another option is [Post Images](https://postimages.org/). When you are ready to share an image in a comment or post, upload the image to the hosting website, right click/select the hosted picture, and in your browser select view image in a new tab. Your image hosting option must only display the image on this tab for the image to display properly here. Copy the link from this new browser tab and paste it into the image URL option inside your posts or comments. The syntax to add the URL image to a comment is ![image](imageURL)"
