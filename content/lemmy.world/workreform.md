description: "A place to discuss positive changes that can make work more equitable, and to vent about current practices. We are NOT against work; we just want the fruits of our labor to be recognized better.**Our Philosophies:**- All workers must be paid a living wage for their labor.- Income inequality is the main cause of lower living standards.- Workers must join together and fight back for what is rightfully theirs.- We must not be divided and conquered. Workers gain the most when they focus on unifying issues.**Our Goals**- Higher wages for underpaid workers.- Better worker representation, including but not limited to unions.- Better and fewer working hours.- Stimulating a massive wave of worker organizing in the United States and beyond.- Organizing and supporting political causes and campaigns that put workers first."
