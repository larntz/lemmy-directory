description: "This is the place to get your fix of the best pops out there! Blackheads, pimples, cysts, and anything of the sort are welcome!# Rules- This community is for sharing the best pimple, and pimple relative, popping content. It is not for food, packing bubbles, or trypophobia content. - This community is not here to provide medical advice. If you are concerned, see a doctor.- Do not steal content. If you did not photograph/film/make the content, don't act like you did. Post links to the original creator when able.- Mark NSFW content as NSFW appropriately. A simple pimple popping is not NSFW, but if you are showing off your latest staph infection that may be NSFL, that would also be NSFW. Any pops on or near genitals, or even that might look like it could be near genitals, should be marked NSFW.- Be nice to the community. A gnarly pop is a good pop. Critique of anyone's physical appearance is unnecessary.I would love to have help moderating and generating content for this community! Remember, it doesn't have to be OC! Anyone that is interested in being a moderator, feel free to send me a message [@theDoctor@lemmy.sdf.org](https://lemmy.sdf.org/u/theDoctor)."
