description: "A community to celebrate published and OC works of poetry.--- # Welcome to !poetry---**Guidelines & Community Rules***In addition to the general rules of lemmy.world:***Published Poetry**  *1a:* Poetry posts should include the title and the author, when the author is known.**O.C. Poetry**  *2a:* Sharing original poetry is encouraged, but it must be preceded by the tag [OC]. *2b:* If an [OC] post is requesting feedback, it should also follow with the [FB] tag. It would look like the following example:  [OC] [FB] Nothing Gold Can Stay  **Feedback**  *All feedback should be given in good faith.**3a:* All [FB] requests should be met with comments constructive in nature. It is okay to dislike parts of a poem, but make sure to explain *why* you feel that way.  *3b:* Feedback does not need to be extraordinary in nature. Simply expressing how a work makes you feel is often enough.   *3c:* Use the honor system. When you receive good feedback, return it in kind to another author. Everyone appreciates knowing their work is being read and appreciated.*As this community develops, these guidelines may be adjusted.*---**Formatting Help**  *Work in progress*To create a line break, use two spaces at the end of a line.To create empty space, type ```&nbsp;```.Use four of these at the beginning of a line to create a standard indent.**UPDATE:**  *Some methods of access do not format markdown correctly. I am currently testing various apps and web interfaces to see what does and does not retain formatting.**In the interim, it is encouraged to post text poetry as you normally would, but to include a link at the beginning or end of the post with access to a website or image that retains the formatting as intended.*  ---**Other Poetry Communities**  Poetry lovers unite! In the style of the fediverse, multiple poetry communities have arisen, and will continue to rise. I will try to keep a list here of communities across instances that are worth checking out!**!poetry@sh.itjust.works**  *I've spoken with the moderator here, and it looks to be a lively space full of modern poetry with a more grungy vibe. It has been quite personally enjoyable for me so far, and I'd love to see it grow as well!*---"
