description: "A community for sharing official recipes from famous restaurants, bars, eateries, chefs, etc. The goal of this community is to preserve our favorite dishes and share them with the world so that they never go extinct because of corporate greed, hubris, or negligence. Please tag your recipe titles with **[RECIPE]**. Be sure to include the dish name and it's creator (person or business) in the title for easier searching.If you're posting a copycat recipe, tag your post with **[COPYCAT]**.All requests should be tagged with **[REQUEST]**. Before you post, make sure someone hasn't already requested the same recipe! **No recipe blog spam! You can link to a personal blog in the comments, but please include the recipe itself in your post. Any post URLs should point to the actual recipe (website, image host, etc.) and not just serve as an advertisement to drive up clicks for your site.**We here in Bootleg Recipes believe that information should be freely available. We learn by observing and analyzing what has come before. We do not believe in secrets. That said, we also believe that food service is a difficult industry, and we fully support dining out whenever possible. *Support your favorite businesses, sing their praises, and tip well!*"
