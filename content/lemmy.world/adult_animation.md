description: "**A place for news and discussion of animated shows, shorts, or movies aimed at audiences 13+.**----------------------------------------**CONDUCT RULES****1) No bigotry** (sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia).**2) Be civil, kind, and try to stay positive.** Not every show is for everyone and you’re free to give a critique; someone giving reasons why they didn’t enjoy something may help others decide if it’s for them. However, if people are discussing a show and you come along just to say, ‘This sucks, I hate it.’ that’s just being negative and unhelpful- Please don’t. Try just not venturing into posts about shows you personally despise.**POST RULES****3) No porn/hentai.****4) EVERYDAY** Posts that are text (comments or questions or discussion starters) or links (articles or videos) and are related in some way to a non-anime adult animation are always welcome, regardless of if a theme day is also active.**5) THEME DAYS****Meme Mondays**Image/Meme/Fanart posts relating to anything animated (adult, family-friendly, and anime) welcome on Mondays. (Remember rule 3; and if you share someone else's art, please credit and link to their social media.)**Anime Tuesdays and Thursdays**Posts pertaining to adult anime welcome on Tuesdays and Thursdays. [Note: Anime means animation originating from Japan. It does not mean animation originating from other Asian countries or Western animation that uses an anime style of art; those would be considered non-anime.]**Family Fridays**Posts pertaining to family-friendly animation (including family-friendly anime) welcome on Fridays.----------------------------------------Full disclosure- I have never moderated a community before. I started this because it’s something I would like to see. If it picks up and I can’t keep up, or whatever, I would be open to turning over the reigns to someone else."
