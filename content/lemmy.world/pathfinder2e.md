description: "A place for people to discuss Pathfinder 2e**Rules:**  **1. Be Kind and Respectful**Criticism of the game or its mechanics should not turn into attacks on a member of the community. Community members are encouraged to ask questions or seek advice, and should be able to expect respectful and courteous answers. In general, treat others of the community as you would a colleague or friend.**2 Do Not Post Copyrighted Content**Content that is not covered by the Open Game License, Open RPG Creative License, and/or made publicly available by Paizo or a third party is not allowed. View Paizo's community use policy.**3. Post Content of Quality**Posts should be able to spark dialogue, add interesting perspectives, educate, and otherwise contribute to the 2E experience. Quality EX: homebrew rules, analysis, something you discovered/encountered, memes that teach mechanics, stuff with a story. Low effort EX: the cover of a rulebook, AI generated content, unconstructive complaints such as I hate... or X sucks, does not relate to Pathfinder 2E.**4. Limit Promotional Posts**This is a community and we welcome your content but we expect your participation in this community in return. Only 1 self-promotion post per week is allowed. Verified content creators may promote new content regularly. Only verified content creators can promote posts which may require purchases, sign-ups, or provide incentives for participation.With the advent of Pathfinder Infinite, users advertising Infinite products will also fall under this rule.**5. Art Post Details and Attribution**Art posts must include a follow-up comment relating them to Pathfinder 2e. This could be a campaign summary, ABC and build, or character profile, as appropriate. You must also credit the artist: images that are uncredited or AI generated will be removed."
