description: "Stop MLM schemes from draining your friends dry.**RULES****1. Content Must Be Clearly MLM-Related***Content must be directly related to MLM. Essential oils, for example, are not in and of themselves a terrible thing, so your aunt's Peppermint Oil Sunscreen recipe does not belong here. Pushing a party to buy the things to make it does*.**2. No Posts About Product Quality/Use of Products***Ugly fabric patterns are not exclusive to LuLaRoe. Poorly-made products can be found anywhere. If the post does not highlight a core problem with the MLM business model, it does not belong here. Lipsense hasn't cornered the market on badly-done makeup, and though pattern matching is a prevalent part of LLR culture, it is not a problem unique to MLM.***3. AMAs Must Be Authorized By Mod Team***AMAs by people currently affiliated with an MLM must be authorized, scheduled, and actively moderated by the mod team. A person wanting to do an AMA must also be willing to submit income and tax statements to the mod team to back up any income claims.***4. Have Mutual Respect***Please be respectful towards others. Any comment/post that is unnecessarily rude, vulgar, offensive or just plain disrespectful will be removed. This includes attacking someone's appearance, using sexually charged derogatory names (LuLahoe, Lipskank, etc), attacking someone's personal beliefs, or just being a plain troll. Remember, people stuck in MLMs are often victims and we strive to be a place that people can come to for advice on how to get out.***5. Ensure ALL Faces are Blurred/Censored***All faces will need to be fully blurred or censored to protect identities and reduce personal attacks on physical features. Such attacks and comments are completely banned here.***6. Censor All Identifying Information***Please ensure all identifying and personal information is omitted from your posts. Personal information includes usernames (yes, even yours), actual names/fake names, phone numbers, addresses, referral links, subreddit names, and specific hashtags. Please ensure you are not using the highlighter tool as it does not adequately censor the information. Your post will be automatically removed and you may be subject to a temporary ban of 5 days.***7. No Reposts***Down with reposts! If you repost something without checking NEW you will suffer a temporary ban. Please see this List of Frequent Reposts before submitting.***8. Low Effort***We get a lot of posts of just screenshots of MLMers initiating a conversation with zero response from OP or just screenshots of a scripted post. If you post a screenshot that does not have a response, it will be removed. If you pose a question regarding if something is an MLM and have clearly not used the search feature, your post will be removed and you will be directed to the stickied Is this an MLM mega thread.***9. Be Truthful***It is important to be accurate and factual. Spreading false information weakens valid arguments against MLMs and reduces credibility. Please make sure any claims about businesses or products are factual. This is not a place for political discussion, we strive to be a place that allows users to be free of misinformation. Left or Right, we can agree that MLMs suck.***10. NO BRIGADING OR DOXXING***You will be immediately banned for doxxing or inciting brigading to this sub or any other sub.***11. Only Specific YouTube or TikTok Content Allowed***Antimlm resources must have a link to the video in description or comments.**Content from participants who are in the MLM CANNOT BE LINKED. This is to prevent doxxing and brigading. However, you may post screenshots of the video/content with all identifying information and faces censored.**Content about creator drama is not allowed.**Content making fun or harassing members of an MLM is prohibited. Content that parodies non-identifiable persons is allowed.***12. No Non-MLM Crypto Posts***Cryptocurrency posts have been determined not to be acceptable content for this sub. Posts about an MLM that sells Cryptocurrency as their product can be included, but general cryptocurrencies is not acceptable.***13. No Self-Promotion***We are strictly against promotion of creators own channel. If you are found to be aggressively promoting a channel or are the creator behind a channel who has posted, you will be banned.*"
