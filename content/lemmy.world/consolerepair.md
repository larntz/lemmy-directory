description: "Anything and everything about retro and modern console repair.  If you've got a broken gaming console you are trying to fix, come here to talk about it.  If you want to flex about a repair, post here. If you or your console's last lover did a non-destructive electronic mod to their console, or have a question about the options available or how to do it, you are welcome to post here.  If you suck at soldering, we still love you, but we might roast you. If you did an extreme modification such as turning one of the few Nintendo Playstations into a Rubik's Cube, flex elsewhere.  If you're trying to FIX a Nintendo Playstation that someone turned into a Rubik's Cube, post away!Other great places:[Console Repair Discord](https://discord.com/servers/console-repair-discord-754165317961383997)[!retrogaming@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/retrogaming) "
