description: "Anime girls that, given half a good reason, *could* and *would*, kill you.1. Posts must feature anime girls known for their murderous ferocity, holding weapons, or expressing malice2. No depictions of murder or excessive violence, the point is to appreciate the character and her readiness to fight, not any gore they perpetrate3. If posting a more suggestive piece, or one with simply a lot of skin, consider still marking it nsfw4. Include a link to the artist in post body, if you can5. No AI generated content6.
