description: "Welcome target archery enthusiasts. This is a community focused on target archery including styles usually associated with [World Archery](https://worldarchery.sport/), indoor, field archery, and 3D. All bow styles are welcome.You’ll probably feel most comfortable here if you have, are, or hope to compete in archery at some point. This is not a hunting community. Bow hunters are welcome here, of course, but this isn’t the place for hunting topics.Questions and conversations about archery gear are welcome, but no excessive bashing of brands or products. Hands-on reviews are welcome; uninformed ranting…not so much. As Ted Lasso would say, “Be curious, not judgmental.”"
