description: "A place to discuss the Japanese anime Space Battleship Yamato, also known as Star Blazers in the United States.Star Blazers (Space Battleship Yamato ) was first broadcast in the United States in 1979. It was the first popular English-translated anime that had an overarching plot and story line that required the episodes to be viewed in order, which paved the way for future arc-based, plot-driven anime translations.All life on Earth is nearly destroyed by a race of hostile extraterrestrials. Another race offers the people of Earth technology to restore their environment, but they have to go to a distant planet to get it. The desperate people of Earth renovate the sunken Japanese battleship Yamato as a space ship to go get the life saving technology."
