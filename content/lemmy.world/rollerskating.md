description: "Welcome to Fediverse-central for your quad skating or inline skating progress, tricks, and photos.A note on rollerskating terms:- Rollerskating is the broad term for many varieties of wheeled, two-boot skating- Quad skating is the term for the classic, four-wheeled rink skates that we all know and love. The wheels are arranged in a rectangle like a skateboard.- Inline skating is the term for skates where the wheels are all in a straight line. Most rollerblades have four wheels per boot like quad skates, but some have three or five wheels per boot.- Rollerblade is the original inline skate company, but not a general term for inline skates. However, sometimes the brand name is used as a general term for inline skates.Unlike the reddit (eww) version of this community, c/Rollerskating is entirely open to all skate varieties!"
