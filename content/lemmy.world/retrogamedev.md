title: "Retro Game/Software Development Discussion" 
name: "retrogamedev"
description: "Discussions related to retro game (or other software) development, on computers or video game consoles.Have you created a game for the C64?  A network utility for Windows 3.11?  *Anything* for the 3DO, Nuon or CD-I?  This is the place for you.  Are you interested in creating retro software or do you have questions about or problems with your current project?  Feel free to ask.Note that this group is related to development of games and software for retro devices, not creating games for modern platforms in a retro style.  Retro-styled games are cool, but they're generally off-topic.Rules:1. Don't be a jerk.2. Don't be racist, homophobic, etc.  (See rule 1).3. Discussion should be limited to games or software being developed for retro platforms.  'Retro' in this case generally means sixth-generation or earlier for consoles, Windows 9x or earlier for x86 PCs, and any pre-2000 non-PC computer platform.4. Commercial self-promotion (i.e. limited boxed runs of games to run on real hardware) is allowed, but shouldn't be the only content that you contribute to the group.  We're as much interested in the process as the product!"
