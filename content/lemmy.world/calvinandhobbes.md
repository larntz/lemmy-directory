description: "Hello fellow Calvin and Hobbes fans! Iâ€™ll be posting the strips in chronological order on the day (usually) they were released. For example, the strip from 16 Oct 1986 will be posted on 16 Oct 2023. Posting them to match the release date adds a bit of nostalgia and fun. Many moons ago, I would bug my Dad to save the newspaper for me everyday so I could read the C&H strip. It really sucked when I missed a day. Only years later, when I got the books was I able to catch up on the missed strips. Of course that won't happen these days, but that's what inspired me post them this way.Hope you enjoy and feel free to contribute C&H stuff of all kinds including art, articles, wallpapers, videos, toys, tattoos, stuff about Bill Watterson, etc!"
