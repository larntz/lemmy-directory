description: "RulesCommunity RulesPlease click the link above for the complete list of community rules. The following list is a summary:1. Remain Civil. It is important that we maintain a civil atmosphere in our subreddit to ensure a positive environment for everyone to contribute in. Treat other users decently as you would treat people in person. This includes not engaging in personal attacks, generalizations about a population, hate-speech, flaming, baiting, trolling, witch-hunting, or unsubstantiated accusations. Report problem posts but especially do not engage in like behaviour.2. No discrimination, period. Racism and other forms of discrimination will not be tolerated. Such comments will be removed at mod discretion and you may be banned. Please report content you see that violates this.3. Don't Feed the Trolls. It is the job of the moderation team to deal with trolls and other non-genuine users, so if you suspect someone of being one report it or message the moderation team with your evidence. Users who engage with trolls may be warned against this behaviour, or banned.4.A: Social Media. Social media posts, such as Twitter, are not allowed. This includes screenshots. You may apply for an exemption if it's an Emergency Alert or other urgent matter. Otherwise, all social media posts will be removed.4.B: News Articles. You must use the original headline as the title and provide a link to the source. Screenshots are not allowed.5. Submitting multiple articles without commenting. If you submit multiple articles or stories please also leave a comment with your submissions to help start the discussion and share your point of view or thoughts. /c/Alberta is for everyone, not just carpet bombing with a single view point or agenda. Share, discuss!6. Duplicate Posts. The first submitted news article is the one we'll keep, duplicates are removed.7. Low Content Posts. Posts that qualify as low content can include things like advertisements, infographics, pictures of headlines, or pictures of politicians with a quote overlaid. These posts are not necessarily disallowed. In these instances, a small write-up to give greater context to the post is required to prevent users from potentially posting this type of content en masse, spamming the sub.8. Not substantive. Non-substantive posts include one-liners or judgements/opinions that or not explained or described with a decent amount of depth. Examples include X is a hypocrite, These people are ridiculous, or I completely agree. Non-substantive posts are not posts that you disagree with.9. Relevant to Alberta. Posts must in some way be relevant to Alberta specifically."
