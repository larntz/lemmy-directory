description: "Unofficial Lemmy Community for all things related to Verizon Wireless.This Lemmy community is based on the r/tmobile subreddit.Any moderator of r/tmobile that would like moderator access here feel free to send me a message.Rules (currently copied from the T-Mobile subreddit):1. No doxxingDo not post someone's personal information. Not only is this against the rules here, it's frowned upon lemmy-wide. Please don't reveal any information that can be used to track someone down in real life. It just simply isn't a nice thing to do. Examples might include the full name of any T-Mo employee who helped you, or something that could be used to put their job in jeopardy.2. Keep it coolSimple. Just be excellent to each other. Don't get too heated, don't start tossing ad hominem attacks at people. Focus on the subject, not the person making the point. And if someone is legitimately trying to help you but you're not getting the answer you want, please don't lash out at people. We're all trying to help to the best of our abilities.3. Don't be negativeIf you need help, please ask! If you're going to complain, make it a constructive complaint. We are all here to help. Posts that are made to bash T-Mobile/Sprint/AnyCarrier/Person/System etc will be removed.Posts that are purely negative and/or do not promote further conversation will be removed.4. Be ethicalDo not be unethical. This includes trying to avoid tethering limitations, offering to bribe employees for device unlocks, or recommending things that break the T&Cs.5. Stay on-topicThe purpose of this lemmy community is to discuss all things T-Mobile. Try and focus on T-Mobile when you make your post. Non-T-Mobile posts are allowed if the goal is a discussion about T-Mobile. Direct links to other carrier's advertisements or press releases will likely be removed. Constructive criticism about T-Mobile is perfectly acceptable, but hate, memes, and pure bashing is not.6. _______ goes in the MegathreadMegathreads are used when popular topics begin generating lots of posts. If there is a megathread on a topic, that is where you post belongs. Please respect this subreddit by asking your question there first. An exception to this rule is if a major change or breaking news about a megathread topic occurs. Your post may be allowable then.7. No account sharingPosts asking for or offering lines on someone elses account, personal or business, is prohibited."
