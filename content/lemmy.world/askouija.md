description: "**Ask Lemmy, Ouija Style**This is like r/AskOuija, but for lemmy; not affiliated to the r/AskOuija though.## RULES> this is adopted rule from r/AskOuija; but due to the difference between Reddit and Lemmy (for example, there is no flair) many things are not doable here.0. No shitposting. This includes posts that start with if this gets X upvotes...1. Posts must ask a question (or be answerable in some way).2. All comments must be a single character, with a couple exceptions:3. If you feel that the Ouija has completed its answer, you may comment with Goodbye to end the thread.4. You may add commentary as long as it's a child comment of a goodbye (in reply to a goodbye, in reply to a comment that's replying to a goodbye, etc).5. You may not reply directly to your own letter comment (this includes replying to your own letter with a Goodbye) but you can still reply multiple times in a thread.6. You may not help answer your own question. You can still reply to a Goodbye, but you cannot add letters or Goodbyes. You've done your job; let the spirits do theirs.7. No bots. These rules are a work-in-progress and subject to change. Feedback is welcome."
