description: "Welcome to a no bullshit digital sanctuary, devoted to the resurgence, sharing, and safeguarding of the 2000s Breakbeat music scene.The revival, coined Netkore by denizens of smallnet circles, has stormed the 2020s underground in a modest fashion alongside similar genres like HexD and Breakcore. Remixes typically pull from trance and 2000s Pop/Euro-dance samples. Sounds from the revival blur the line with HexD and Nightcore, relying on crunchy compression and high tempo.In the midst of the digital static, we value the ephemeral, transient, and the overlooked."
