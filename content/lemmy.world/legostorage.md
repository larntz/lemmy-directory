description: "It doesn't matter if you have 10 or 10,000,000 Lego parts, storage and organization are necessary. This community is dedicated to discussions about organizing parts, pictures and videos of part storage and organization, and links to suggested bins and containers.────────**#Rules** • Please follow lemmy etiquette.  • Please stay on topic. This community is meant to be a place for discussing storage, not arguments over things such as ideologies or politics. From time to time something off-topic will be allowed if it is of significant interest to the community, such as an amazing Lego creation posted to the wrong place, or, on very rare occasions, to highlight something of important across all of Lemmy. • Auction website links won't be permitted, only to prevent people from spamming their own auctions. • Promoting your own storage or display products is fine, but please limit yourself on how often you promote them. If your account is mainly used for promoting products, your post will likely be removed. • URL shorteners are unnecessary here and won't be permitted. • This is a SFW community. NSFW content will be removed.────────**#Reference Links** • [Evolution of Sorting](http://news.lugnet.com/storage/?n=707) • [Flickr Lego Storage Group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/1043272@N22/pool/)────────**#Related Communities** • [/c/Lego](https://lemmy.world/c/Lego) - For all things Lego"
