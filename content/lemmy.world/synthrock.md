description: "For lovers of synthesizers and guitars!This community is for sharing music. Make sure you are linking to some sort of music media rather than an article, image, band page, or anything non-music (like news). Please keep text posts to a minimum as well. Music videos are preferred (including fan made), but just audio is fine too. Please only share live performances if they are exceptionally good, studio recordings are preferred. If a band/arist has their own official posting of the video/song on YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, etc, please link to their version if available (although exceptions can be made if the media quality is low). Full Albums and EPs are welcome too.Bands and artists feel free to post your own songs, just please don't overpost and spam us.Please follow the naming convention <artist> - <song title>. If it's a (remix) or (live) version please mention so in the title. Also please mark your potentially NSFW videos. Lastly end the title with a media type in [brackets], ex: audio, music video, album, visualizer.Example post title:Depeche Mode - Enjoy the Silence (remix) [lyric video]What kind of music belongs here? We view synth rock as a high level, meta genre that encompases many others. So, just about any sub-genre is welcome, as long as it both rocks and uses electronic instrumentation. Both guitars and synthesizers are preferred, but not required. Some good genre examples would be Dance-Punk, Electroclash, Alternative Rock, Indie Electronica, Big Beat, Industrial Rock, Industrial Metal, AggroTech, FuturePop, DreamPop, DeathPop, DarkWave, IJPP, ElectroFunk, New Wave, NuGaze, Post-punk, TripHop or even some particularly rocking ChipTunes. We tend to focus on new releases and lesser known bands, but classic tracks and the well known are welcome too."
