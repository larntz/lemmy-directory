description: "This is a community for the discussion of pedelecs, also known as pedal-assist electric bicycles! These are bicycles with a motor that gives your pedaling a little extra boost.***Rules:*****1. Respect others.**Remember there is a person on the other side of the screen. Trolling, ad hominems, racism, sexism, transphobia, xenophobia, threats, and other derogatory remarks are prohibited. If you come across comments that violate this rule, please report them.**2. Submissions must center around, or heavily relate to, pedal-assist e-bikes.**Submissions about e-bikes that only have throttle functionality are not permitted. This includes submissions about mopeds and motorcycles. Exceptions may be made if the post contents are sufficiently relevant to pedelecs, but this will be at the moderators' discretion.**3. News article submissions must have unaltered titles.**When you're posting a news article, please use the original headline only. Do not editorialize, commentate, or add any other text in the title. If you have thoughts on the article you are posting, you may include them in the comments.**4. Uphold the spirit of this community. Do not gatekeep.**We are people who either use pedelecs, or who are interested in using pedelecs in the future, for varying purposes. Unlike conventional American wisdom, cycling is not strictly a sport - many people around the world view cycling as a utilitarian venture. We hope to acknowledge this, and thus foster an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere here. We will not tolerate elitism or gatekeeping. Please do not call someone lazy or not a real cyclist for using a pedelec."
