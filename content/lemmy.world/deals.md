No drop-shipping/Shopify stores/self-promotion/Kickstarters/user-to-user sales/PM me for details.Although self-promotion can lead to great deals for users, the likelihood that the deals aren't true deals is reason enough to exclude them. Also, this is not Craigslist and you can't take advantage of people with your Shopify store.5.
