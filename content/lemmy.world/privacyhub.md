description: "Privacy hub is your one stop hub for all things privacy, security and freedom. We know that there’s nothing private in the internet. But at least we can find ways to minimize risk by identifying threat models and act accordingly. Got a story to tell? Or something to share? Feel free to jump in!UPDATE: Got started with a guide here: https://lemmy.world/post/954144Will add more soon. Until a more comprehensive list can be made in this community check out https://www.privacytools.io/ as a starting place to begin your privacy journey. NOTE: that some recommendations in that site are closed-source as pointed out by @lemmy.world/u/rooki.Some ammendments we would like to point out- nextdns -> if you can self host “pihole” is 100% open source and free- Surfshark -> use MULLVAD instead. It’s affordable and has been audited.- Keepass as a password manager. PrivacyHub is a place where users from the fediverse are welcome to discuss, answer, share news and exchange best privacy practices."
