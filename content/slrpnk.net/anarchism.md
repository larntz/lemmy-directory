description: "# AnarchismA community about anarchy and anarchism for SLRPNK! Solarpunk anarchist unite!Feel free to ask questions here. We aspire to make this space a safe space. SLRPNK.net's basic rules apply here, but generally don't be a dick and don't be an authoritarian.# Quotes> Poetry and imagination must be integrated with science and technology, for we have evolved beyond an innocence that can be nourished exclusively by myths and dreams.~ Murray Bookchin, *The Ecology of Freedom*> People want to treat ‘we’ll figure it out by working to get there’ as some sort of rhetorical evasion instead of being a fundamental expression of trust in the power of conscious collective effort. ~Anonymous, but quoted by Mariame Kaba, *We Do This 'Til We Free Us*> The end justifies the means. But what if there never is an end? All we have is means.~Ursula K. Le Guin, *The Lathe of Heaven* > The assumption that what currently exists must necessarily exist is the acid that corrodes all visionary thinking.~Murray Bookchin, A Politics for the Twenty-First Century> There can be no separation of the revolutionary process from the revolutionary goal. *A society based on self-administration must be achieved by means of self-administration.*~Murray Bookchin, *Post Scarcity Anarchism*# Network* [!anarchism@slrpnk.net](https://slrpnk.net/c/anarchism)* [!anarchism@lemmy.dbzer0.com](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/anarchism)* [!anarchism@lemmy.fmhy.ml](https://lemmy.fmhy.ml/c/anarchism)* [!anarchism@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/anarchism)"
