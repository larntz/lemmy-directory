description: "# !anarchism@slrpnk.net A community about anarchy. anarchism, social ecology, and communalism for SLRPNK! Solarpunk anarchists unite!Feel free to ask questions here. We aspire to make this space a safe space. SLRPNK.net's basic rules apply here, but generally don't be a dick and don't be an authoritarian.# AnarchismAnarchism is a social and political theory and practice that works for a free society without domination and hierarchy. # Social Ecology Social Ecology, developed from green anarchism, is the idea that our ecological problems have their ultimate roots in our social problems. This is because the domination of nature and our ecology by humanity has its ultimate roots in the domination humanity by humans. Therefore, the solutions to our ecological problems are found by addressing our social and ecological problems simultaneously. # Quotes> Poetry and imagination must be integrated with science and technology, for we have evolved beyond an innocence that can be nourished exclusively by myths and dreams.~ Murray Bookchin, *The Ecology of Freedom*> People want to treat ‘we’ll figure it out by working to get there’ as some sort of rhetorical evasion instead of being a fundamental expression of trust in the power of conscious collective effort. ~Anonymous, but quoted by Mariame Kaba, *We Do This 'Til We Free Us*> The end justifies the means. But what if there never is an end? All we have is means.~Ursula K. Le Guin, *The Lathe of Heaven* > The assumption that what currently exists must necessarily exist is the acid that corrodes all visionary thinking.~Murray Bookchin, A Politics for the Twenty-First Century> There can be no separation of the revolutionary process from the revolutionary goal. *A society based on self-administration must be achieved by means of self-administration.*~Murray Bookchin, *Post Scarcity Anarchism*> In modern times humans have become a wolf not only to humans, but to all nature.~Abdullah Öcalan> The ecological question is fundamentally solved as the system is repressed and a socialist social system develops. That does not mean you cannot do something for the environment right away. On the contrary, it is necessary to combine the fight for the environment with the struggle for a general social revolution...~Abdullah Öcalan> Social ecology advances a message that calls not only for a society free of hierarchy and hierarchical sensibilities, but for an ethics that places humanity in the natural world as an agent for rendering evolution social and natural fully self-conscious.~ Murray Bookchin# Network* [!anarchism@slrpnk.net](https://slrpnk.net/c/anarchism)* [!anarchism@lemmy.dbzer0.com](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/anarchism)* [!anarchism@lemmy.fmhy.ml](https://lemmy.fmhy.ml/c/anarchism)* [!anarchism@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/anarchism)"
