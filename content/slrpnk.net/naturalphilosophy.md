title: "Natural Philosophy" 
name: "naturalphilosophy"
description: "A collaborative space of exploration into questions about the natural world, and meta-questions such as what constitutes an answer, a question, or why we can even ask questions in the first place.Submissions should be relevant to scientific subjects *somehow* rooted in physics. It can get blurry sometimes, but if you can answer the question How could this help us understand the nature of our perceived reality? you should be ok.These are the informal guidelines we follow here:1. The questions we pose, we believe to have [falsifiable answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability).2. The answers we put forth, we believe to be falsifiable.3. The discussions we have, we have in good faith and in the genuine interest of identifying, understanding or communicating the kind of questions and answers we believe can satisfy the above points.4. The arguments we present, we make a reasonable effort to present alongside assumptions and biases we are able to identify as relevant, and we remain humble to the fact that we can't identify them all.Submissions and comments are moderated on a subjective case-by-case basis to facilitate and maintain a healthy, cosy, and rewarding environment for you who would come here with a genuine interest in learning, participating or merely observing others engage in natural philosophy. Just to state some obvious (non-exhaustive set of) behaviours and content we won't have here: bigotry; hate speech; [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning); [strawmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man); pseudo-/anti-science; dis-/misinformation. Additional context may be taken into consideration as well.For those of you on Matrix, there is a super-space which tries to aggregate scientific chat rooms and spaces: https://matrix.to/#/#science-space:matrix.org"
