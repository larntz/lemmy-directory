description: "hey! I'm a moderator (u/KomaedaEatsBagels) of r/TranscribersOfReddit, a now-shuttered project to provide accessibility to blind and visually impaired users. While *I as an individual am* affiliated with r/ToR's parent 501(c) nonprofit organization Grafeas Group, *this archive and my transcriptions on Lemmy are not.* I just wanted a nice little box to put my transcriptions in for both my purposes and the purposes of blind, visually impaired, and/or low-data Lemmy users. If you would like to also transcribe posts for yourself, go check out the r/TranscribersOfReddit wiki for some handy guidelines and templates! https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/guidelines/"
