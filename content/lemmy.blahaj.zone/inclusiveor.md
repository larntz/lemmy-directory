description: "The mods of r/InclusiveOr don't seem to want to migrate, so I'm starting this community here.**Rule 1: Posts must include an Inclusive Or.**They need to show an instance of a question being replied to with multiple or all possible answers. Example: Is it X or Y? Yes.**Rule 2: Posts must consist of a screenshot.**Only submit screenshots of the specific event. Make sure to include both the question being asked and the inclusive OR. It is recommended (but not necessary) to link to the source of the screenshot - you can get the link of the comment by clicking the spider-web Fediverse icon by the specific comment.**Rule 2a: No extraneous content.**Don't draw on, or add unreleated content to, the screenshot - even if requested. Content that highlights part of a post is fine if it serves a purpose. Requests to be in the screenshot, if not themselves humorous, should also be cropped out.**Rule 2b: Don't submit your own Inclusive Or.**At least one other person must find it funny for it to belong here. It isn't a very high bar.**Rule 3: Be civil!**We are here to have fun. Don't make fun of the people in the post - the humour comes from the words they're saying! Hate speech and insults will result in an immediate ban.**Rule 4: Only post here once per Inclusive Or.**You can repost things here that have been posted elsewhere on Lemmy, but only post each Inclusive Or here once.**Rule 5: No political posts.**There are places on Lemmy to discuss politics. This is not one of them.**Rule 6: The moderator decides what is and isn't against the rules.**Arguing with the moderator without cause will result in a ban."
