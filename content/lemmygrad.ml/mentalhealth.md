I will not allow a breakdown of decorum in this support focused community. If you want to scream about how terrible psychiatry is or shit talk anti-psychiatry, find another community for that. or make a new one.- This is a positive and supportive place, treat others like you want to be treated, give someone the benefit of the doubt, and help where you can help."
