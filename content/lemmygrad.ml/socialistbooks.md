However, the [general rule against sectarianism](https://communism.lemmy.ml) still applies here. A writing that takes a potshot at others every now and then is acceptable. Outright polemics dedicated to denouncing other tendencies belong elsewhere.3. No linking to online book stores.4. No memes or videos."
