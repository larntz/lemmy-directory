description: "Community for transhumanists, discussion of transhumanism, news about transhumanism-adjacent technologies, information on related technologies, transhumanist philosophy, and things you are doing now personally or in an organisation to push forward the technology and political foundations for transhumanism.Definition of transhumanism I'm using: > The promotion of widespread access to - and development of - technology to alter, improve (by your own definitions), integrate with, or completely replace your body and control your very identity, in the name of self-determination and autonomy - up to and including immortality and total digitization, but not only that!>> Also, an exploration of the consequences of the types of development associated with transhumanism and the positive and negative responses to it.I actually use a more philosophical definition personally but this is close enough to what I think transhumanism is.Community rules:* No bigotry - in particular, if you're on a transhumanism community and hating on trans people, maybe think about that for a few minutes to realise how silly that is :)* No advocating for eugenics or malthusian ideology (too many people)* Be vigilant about snake-oil claims - this is important general advice for reading about longevity research.Given that this is also hosted on a somewhat infosec oriented instance (infosec.pub), I hope we can discuss some of the privacy aspects of transhumanism and related tech too :)"
