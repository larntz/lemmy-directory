description: "# Info20hirnzelle is a community that dives into the abysses of journalism in Switzerland. We want to provide a platform to share, discuss, critique, and laugh about the worst Swiss journalism has to offer. Although there are countless examples of articles that are infuriating, racist, sexist, misogynistic, or even worse â€“ we hold ourselves to higher standards.So please keep it civil, be nice, and don't attack journalists on a personal level either.The official languages of this sub will be Swiss German, German, and English. The other Swiss languages can't be supported at the beginning, since the mod team lacks the necessary language skills.---# Rules- **Be nice**- No racism, antisemitism, misogyny or any other form of douchebaggery- Articles of all **Swiss** news outlets are allowed, not only from our namesake 20min- Post pictures instead of direct links, we don't want to reward bad journalism with additional traffic- Don't attack journalists on a personal level, no witchhunt, no doxxing etc."
