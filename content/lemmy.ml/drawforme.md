description: "This is a request forum for people who would like to see their ideas, photos, and concepts created by by both paid and volunteered artists.ALL MEDIUMS ARE WELCOME (i.e. pencil, stencil, pen, macaroni, pictures, etch and sketch etc.).Rules    Rule 1 Please flair your post appropriately. [Free Request] or [Paid Request] if you want artwork, or [Free Offer] or [Paid Offer] if you're offering artwork. Artists may use the [Request Fulfilled] flair to post fulfilled artwork to the sub. Art trades are not allowed.    Rule 2 Please be descriptive in your title. We do not allow This is me/X/thing, My dog/niece/X or just emojis. We also do not allow Discord handles, @usernames, e-mail addresses and URLs in post titles. Titles should be formatted as Can you please draw X? It has to be a question, not a statement.    Rule 3 Do not spam on this sub, With the exception of Request Fulfilled posts, users are only allowed one Free Request post per week, and only post Paid Offers once a week during Saturdays and Sundays. Deleted reposting and post bumping is a bannable offense. You will be tempbanned if you are caught spamming after a warning, and permanently banned afterwards.    Rule 4 While we allow free requests, we do not allow commercial, non-personal free requests. This is a tempban-on-sight offense, no questions asked. Things we don't allow as free requests include book covers, Youtube and Twitch graphics, logos and album covers. We also do not allow hiring competitions, work-for-free-first agreements and spec work. No public tipping, or promising a tip for an art request. All logos and icons are blanket banned, and any artwork for physical items/objects. Please read our complete rule about this.    Rule 5 Do not use this board to self-promote yourself. This includes treating the sub to post non-sublemmy artwork, status updates and using it like Tumblr/social media. We also do not look kindly on comment spam; engage with the community, do not copy-paste the same blog of text over and over again. Our subs not the place to grow your art Youtube/TikTok/Twitch channel.    Rule 6 Offers must follow posting rules, read our guidelines here. Free Offers must have an art example, and must have one fulfilled request in the comments in 7 days. Paid Offers must physically link with a clickable URL to an art portfolio such as Artstation, Instagram or the like. Twitter, art stores and Discord are not allowed as sole links. Request Fulfilled posts must include the u/ handle of the person the request is for, and physically link to the thread on DrawForMe in the comments. Any off-subrequests fulfilled are prohibited on the board.    Rule 7 Be Civil. Don't insult artists, be courteous to one another. Art theft and scamming is prohibited. Mod abuse is not tolerated, and cursing at the mod team in any fashion will earn you an instant ban. Politics and hot-button topics do not belong here.    Rule 8 This is a sub for art requests for this community. We don't allow irrelevant content on the board; his is specifically to art tutorial videos and non-sub artwork. This goes in hand with Rule 5, but we're not the place to show off your artwork. WIPs and updates are prohibited.    Rule 9 Sent a PM/Chat/Message and PM me for Info comments are not allowed. If you need to verify yourself that you're not banned that's fine, but don't just comment that you're sending a message, DM sent, sending a message your way, etc.    Rule 10 Be reasonable with Free Requests. If it takes more than an hour to do or costs more than $10, please pay the artist for their time. Artists have every right to refuse a free request. Don't expect highly-detailed pieces for free. Max 2 characters, or one character the way you want it. Requests for wallpapers, large groups and specific art styles outside of medium are unreasonable.    Rule 11 Contests must be approved and vetted by the mod team. They will be automatically removed if they have not been contacted.    Rule 12 Compensation must be valid payment. Artists need real, secure money for their life needs. Exposure, credit and such are not valid compensation. This includes online game subscriptions, Discord ranks, Nook Miles tickets, etc. Gift cards, Western Union and non-refundable/protected payment methods are not allowed, and is a bannable offense. CashApp, Zelle and Venmo are not allowed as they're non-refundable. Includes Crypto and NFT. Because of this rule, art trades are not allowed.    Rule 13 Do not fulfill Paid Requests for free, and do not solicit commissions on Free Requests. If you are fulfilling a free request, please make sure it's not a user breaking our rules getting free work. Obvious signs are logos, book covers, wallpapers and things to be used in real life for their benefit.    Rule 14 You must pay for your tattoo requests here. This includes concept and layout work. You will be banned if you're caught, then attempt to repost as a drawing request.
