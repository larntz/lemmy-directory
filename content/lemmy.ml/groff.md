name: "groff"
description: "Groff (GNU troff) is a typesetting system that reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output. Output may be PostScript or PDF, html, or ASCII/UTF-8 for display at the terminal. Present on most Unix systems owing to its long association with Unix manuals (manpages), groff is capable of producing typographically sophisticated documents while consuming only minimal system resources.-- from GNU(link: https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/)Feel free to ask questions about the roff family and its many macros! Interested in learning more? Type `man groff` or `info groff` into your terminal to read the documentation. A good macro to start with is the `ms` macro!Note: you may have to install groff using your package manager for its full capabilities, as many GNU+Linux distributions only ship with the base package used in manpages.Related lemmys:* https://lemmy.ml/c/latexIcon: John A Prior Health Sciences Library Mural Typesetter(link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_A_Prior_Health_Sciences_Library_Mural_Typesetter.jpg)Banner: Metal movable type(link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Metal_movable_type.jpg)Icon Attribution: Ehschnell at English WikipediaBanner Attribution: Willi HeidelbachIcon & Banner License: Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported(link: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en)"
