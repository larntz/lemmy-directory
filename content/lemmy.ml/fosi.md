description: "It happens to us all to have good ideas but unfortunately we don't always have the time or the ability to realize them... Instead of these ideas getting lost or dying we can share them and maybe they will be heard by someone in the free software community who is in need of inspiration but has the time and ability to realize them. ðŸ¤žYou can also share your idea and ask if people in the community are interested in helping you make it happen.#FOSI"
