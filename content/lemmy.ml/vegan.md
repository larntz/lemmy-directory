description: "An online space for the vegans of Lemmy.**Rules and miscellaneous**:1. We take for granted that if you engage in this community, you understand that veganism is about the animals. You either are vegan for the animals, or you are not (this is **not** to say that discussions about climate/environment/health are not allowed, of course)2. No omni/carnist apologists. This is not a place where to ask to be hand-holded into veganims. Omnis coddling/backpatting is not tolerated, nor are /r/DebateAVegan-like threads3. Use content warnings and NSFW tags for triggering content4. Circlejerking belongs to [/c/vegancirclejerk](https://lemmy.ml/c/vegancirclejerk)5. All posts should abide by Lemmy's Code of Conduct"
