description: "A place for perfectly looped animated gifs or html5 videos.Rules:- Posted media needs to restart automatically.- Must be seamless. No visible beginning and end. Something must always smoothly be carried over from one frame to the next. Some elements that can be considered a seam include but are not limit to: noticeable cuts, objects/parts that noticeably jump, a point that is just static background or one solid color, screen wipe or other transitions between unrelated shots, etc.- No usage of tricks that get back to the beginning without actually looping/cycling. This includes but is not limited to reversing back to the beginning (ping-ponging or boomerang effect), cloning (where duplicates of an object that would not loop on it's own are used to keep constant action in frame), glitches (intentional or not), etc."
