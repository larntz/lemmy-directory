description: "A friend of mine once said:>You know what the problem is with being an economist? Everyone has an opinion about the economy. Nobody goes up to a geologist and says, Igneous rocks are fucking bullshit.This community is the repository for all of the woeful, antiquated, or plain old misguided notions people say about how the economy works.# Rules## RIAll posts must explain why the content is bad economics. You don't need to write a dissertation, but at *minimum* write a paragraph or two with sources."
