description: "A community dedicated to the works of Shouzou Kaga, designer of the original Fire Emblem Games as well as titles like Tear Ring, Berwick, and Vestaria Sagas.Rules:* Discussion of Fire Emblem is fine so long as it is within the realm of the Kaga developed games (so any from FE5/Thracia 776 and below)* Submissions must relate to the given games on some level. That said, romhacks are allowed (Super Thracia, New Theory, Berwick Redux, etc)* No NSFW is instancewide, so no NSFW here.* Memes are fine but they should have a little effort, no excessive low effort spam.* Since flairs aren't a thing, it is currently recommended to mark posts based on both the game and subject if possible, (ex: [FE5] [Artwork], though substituting the numbers for Thracia or anything similar regarding title is fine.)* Play Berwick Saga, this isn't a rule but do it anyway."
