description: "This is one of several candidates to be an alternative or replacement for the subreddit /r/nerf, either permanently or temporarily during the protest. It's still under construction. Posts are closed for now. ::: spoiler Are you new to Lemmy? Please click here to expand.Lemmy is a lot like reddit. For most purposes you can treat it as if it *is* reddit.The main difference is that when you view your front page or search for other communities, you have a choice between subscribed (what you've already joined), local (a small subset of communities) and all (every community that this server knows about). discuss.online is one of many Lemmy servers and many of the communities that you see here originate on other servers - but this networking is handled behind the scenes. This decentralization makes Lemmy resilient but you can still use it just like reddit. [A longer explanation can be found here.](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/users/01-getting-started.html):::# Community standardsWe maintain a higher standard of civility here than an average forum. Please be nice, and be forgiving: the other guy might be literally a kid. We have moderate post quality standards here; nerfchatter is very lax.We have some idiosyncratic rules (next section) including topics that we direct elsewhere (further below). Please take a minute to read them before posting. It’s “blaster/dart,” not “gun/bullet” - because the latter can cause [serious problems]. Similarly, it's good to be clear that realistic blasters shouldn't be used in public spaces for the benefit of our young readers.# Community rules* Don’t spam (post excessively) or excessively self-promote. [How much is too much]?* Only post thrift finds on Thursday. [Is it Thursday?]* Don’t recommend dangerous practices, [such as these]. There is to be absolutely no deliberate weaponization, even as a joke or against nonhuman targets. * Pirated/knockoff versions of hobby-made designs should not be shared; don’t give pirates free advertising. * Respect community standards (above) and stay on-topic (below).# What we aren’t* 3d printing questions not specific to nerf should go on 3d printing communities. * You can buy/sell/trade/“what’s it worth?” on /r/nerfexchange (though we may make an exchange Lemmy community later).* No scripted battle footage. We have to ban this so that we don’t get flooded with it. This is very easy to find on YouTube if you for some reason want to see it. * No memes/jokes; there may be rare exceptions for discussions of ongoing events. Again, we have to ban this to not be flooded by it. Nerfchatter is the place for that.  # TagsTagging makes your post easier for people to find, although it’s not required. You can tag a post by including a tag (including the square brackets) anywhere in the title. As a rule of thumb, we suggest that tags higher on this list take priority if more than one could apply. [Links are to a search: this community, newest first, search for the tag]**Resources**[help][download] - A 3d printable blaster or accessory that's ready to download and print. [guide] - Writeups (and occasionally videos) describing how to do something. [review]**Playing**[event] - An upcoming game looking for players.[LFG] - Looking For Group.**Showing off**[completed] - A completed project: paintjob, performance mod, integration, etc.[WIP] - As above except *not* completed but still something you want to share. [thrift] - Hey, look what I just found for cheap in a thrift store![armory] - A picture of your entire collection. [selfpromotion] - Do you have something to sell?
