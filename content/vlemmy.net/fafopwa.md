description: "**Description**- This is a safe space for friends and family of addicts to share stories, give support, and post resources for addiction. - This is not a group for people currently experiencing addiction. There are other Fediverse communities with that purpose, and I plan to facilitate my own in the future as well. **Notes**- This is not exclusive to drug addiction, as there are many types of addiction.- I intend to add resources as I am able. **Chat**- There is a Matrix channel for a more live-style chat. It can be found at: https://matrix.to/#/%23fafopwa%3Amatrix.org- Element is a popular client for Matrix channels and is available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/element-messenger/id1083446067), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app), and [other platforms](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/element/)**Resources**- [Dr Gabor Maté](https://drgabormate.com/) has one of the most comprehensive understandings of addiction that I have found. His book [In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts](https://www.amazon.com/Realm-Hungry-Ghosts-Encounters-Addiction/dp/155643880X/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=1UGGE1XJMMIV9&keywords=in+the+realm+of+hungry+ghosts+gabor+mate&qid=1688464642&sprefix=in+the+real%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1) helps people understand the reason for addiction as we understand it currently. - [Addict in the House](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1626252602/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1688464788&sr=8-1) by Robin Barnett has a more direct approach for “okay, now what can I actually do in my situation?”**Related Communities**- [!mentalhealth@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/mentalhealth) **Disclaimer**- This will not replace counseling, therapy, or medical advice. If you find yourself in an emergent situation, call 911 (in the US) for medical assistance or 988 for mental health crisis. "
