description: "Community dedicated to sharing furry themed wallpapers.**Pro-tip:** You can use the tags 16:9, 9:16, hi_res,ratio:<0.6, ratio:>1.5, -comic, -text and similar on e621 or e926.- All submissions should be at least 900px high or wide on their shortest side. Exceptions can be made for older artwork (pre-HD era) or artwork that is uniquely suited.- DO NOT scale, crop alter or modify the image in any way unless it's your own art. Every user will have to do their own adjustments after downloading an image.- The image's composition should be at least somewhat suitable for wallpaper use. For example, an HD comic while large enough would not be reminiscent of a wallpaper. This won't be enforced super strictly. Don't worry, it's just to give a guideline.- Use the tags [horizontal] or [vertical] to describe the orientation. This will help both desktop and phone users.- Flag anything that could be NSFW, including suggestive and questionable artwork.- All titles must include attribution.- Please include a link to the artist's profile, gallery or social media in the body of the post.- Don't post underage characters in NSFW posts.- Don't post artwork from artists in the DNP list- Submissions may contain any gender and any form (anthro/feral/taur/etc.), but any kinks displayed should be mostly vanilla or light.- As courtesy, please tag anything NSFW that people might want to avoid. For example: [feral], [taur], [bdsm], etc..."
