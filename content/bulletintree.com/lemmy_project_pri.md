title: "Lemmy Project Priorities Observations" 
name: "lemmy_project_pri"
description: "I've raised my voice loudly on meta communities, github, and created new [!lemmyperformance@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/lemmyperformance)  and [!lemmycode@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/lemmycode)  communities.I feel like the performance problems are being ignored for over 30 days when there are a half-dozen solutions that could be coded in 5 to 10 hours of labor by one person.I've been developing client/server messaging apps professionally since 1984, and I firmly believe that Lemmy is currently suffering from a lack of testing by the developers and lack of concern for data loss. A basic e-mail MTA in 1993 would send a did not deliver message back to message sender, but Lemmy just drops delivery and there is no mention of this in the release notes//introduction on GitHub. I also find that the Lemmy developers do not like to eat their own dog food and actually use Lemmy's communities to discuss the ongoing development and priorities of Lemmy coding. They are not testing the code and sampling the data very much, and I am posting here, using Lemmy code, as part of my personal testing!  I spent over 100 hours in June 2023 testing Lemmy technical problems, especially with performance and lost data delivery.I'll toss it into this **echo chamber**."
