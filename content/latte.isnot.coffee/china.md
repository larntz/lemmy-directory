description: "An alternative for /r/china**R1: Be respectful.** No directed offensive language or personal attacks are allowed. Profanity is allowed, but not if it’s directed at others. Racism, sexism, and slurs or similar remarks are not allowed in either English or Chinese, including in usernames.**R2: No bad faith behavior.** Bad faith behavior can include combative argumentation or statements intended to disrupt others’ points of view rather than engaging with them, attempts to provoke others into being caustic, making derisive remarks that add little value, or otherwise participating in discussions to the detriment of others. Making extreme unsubstantiated claims or sharing materials that are low in substance but high in outrage may also lead to removal.**R3: Media policy.** Memes, images, videos, gifs, and other types of media are allowed but are strictly moderated. Media regarding real life people and events should provide appropriately sourced background context or risk deletion. On a spectrum from daily life musings to cultural commentary to political soapboxing, moderation of media will tighten. Media concerning topics that have already been discussed at length will likely be deleted. See also r/ChinaMemes**R4: Post title policy.** Posts with low-effort, editorialized, provocative, inaccurate, sensationalist, or misleading titles will be removed and may result in a ban. In addition, posts linking to news articles or other third-party content in English must match the title of the original source or will be removed.**R5: No reposts / One post per topic.** When posting about current events or new developments, please check if there are already other submissions on the topic. We regularly delete subsequent posts about the same topic, even if they provide additional information or context. If you would like to share additional information about something that has already been posted, please do so as a comment in the original thread.**R6: Posts must be related to China.** Content that is only tangentially or incidentally related to China will generally be deleted.**R7: Submit the best source format.** Submissions should be of the best available source format. For example, twitter posts should be submitted as links, not as screenshots. If your post is removed for this reason, you may resubmit it after appropriately selecting a better format.**R8: No meta-drama** References to other subreddits that tend to cause drama, or contain Reddit Content Policy violations or other issues such as hate speech or misinformation, will likely be removed. Posts about bans or removals on other subreddits are not allowed.**R9: If posting in Chinese, please translate at least the post title** / 规则11：如果发布中文贴子，请至少将标题翻译成英文"
