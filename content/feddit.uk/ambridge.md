description: "[r/ambridge](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ambridge/) is a subreddit for discussion of BBC Radio 4's *The Archers* . There's currently a poll exploring whether to migrate to Lemmy. This Lemmy community was made: - in case we do decide to migrate, and - to see if there's enough interest in the Lemmyverse to sustain its own *The Archers* community. - test out mod tools on LemmyHey, there's no rule that says there can't be two *The Archers* discussion boards on the internet."
