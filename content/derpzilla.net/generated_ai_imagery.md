description: "Imagery generated by artificial intelligence / machine learning using keywords from community subscribers.Each post (or thread) represents a theme. Optionally, generated images can default to the model specified in between brackets, in the post title. For example:`Halloween 2022 art thread! [model=dreamlike-art/dreamlike-diffusion-1.0]`All top-level comments to the thread will result in a new AI image being generated from the keywords in the comment. The generated image can take several minutes to appear, but will eventually show up as a reply to the comment.Additional parameters can be referenced within the comment:- `width=512`- `height=512`- `steps=50`- `model=stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1`- `seed=<random number>`- `negate=<negative prompt>`For example, a comment could be:`A spooky house atop a small bluff with a full moon and dark sky, bats flying across the moon and a witch in the top right corner flying on her broom, black cat stands on the house porch staring at the viewer with the door partially open width=768 height=512 steps=45 seed=123456789 negate=cartoon,low quality`AI models are trained using differing input datasets. So the resulting image will typically vary significantly from other models. ::: spoiler spoiler___:::"
