description: "## DescriptionHentai, ecchi, and romantic artwork depicting both male/female character(s).This community was originally created because the founder is mainly attracted to men, and wading through the sea of solo-F hentai is tiresome. While it's nice to show as much of the male body as possible, it's not a strict rule.::: spoiler DisclaimerAlthough this subreddit is dedicated to hetero hentai, we do NOT tolerate any expression of hate, bigotry, homophobia, or transphobia based on sexuality or gender. Submissions of transgender / GNC / futanari characters are totally welcome, affirmed, and treated flexibly. If you think it's kinda straight-ish, then it belongs here!:::___## Rules- Art must depict at least one male and female character (partial bodies ok!)- Drawn/illustrated art only.- No NSFL, gore, scat, loli/shota.- No spam/advertising.- Be kind and respectful.- Don't kinkshame/gatekeep."
