Please only post content relevant to the City of Ottawa or to its residents.---### Ottawa on the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse):*empty*### Ottawa chatrooms:* XMPP: *empty** Matrix: [https://matrix.to/#/#ottawa:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ottawa:matrix.org)* Telegram: [https://t.me/chatottawa](https://t.me/chatottawa)* Discord: [https://discord.gg/TrCHrucmqJ](https://discord.gg/TrCHrucmqJ)Please note the following:* All chatrooms are linked together. If you join one room your messages will be copied to the other platforms.* Matrix is an open source and potentially distributed chat protocol. The matrix room listed is hosted on matrix.org, a somewhat centralized hub for a lot of currently public rooms. Though the protocol itself is free, libre and open source, the deployment of the protocol resembles a centralized service. This may be fixed in the future with the deployment of independent servers.* Be aware that both Telegram and Discord are centralized proprietary platforms and do not necessarily protect your rights nor privacy while simultaneously giving power to corporations."
