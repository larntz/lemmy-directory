name: "software_alternatives_linux"
description: "This is a sister community to [!linux@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/linux).Many members there are computer users who recently moved to Linux from other OSs, Windows in particular. Having established their work and hobbies on a particular software base, they often encounter difficulties trying to find similar software on Linux.Here you can ask, propose, comment about some software alternative you're looking for.It's important to be broad-minded when speaking about *software alternatives* when switching to Linux:- **Exactly the same software could be available for Linux.**- **Different software but with similar critical features could be available for Linux.**- **It could be possible to use emulators (such as Wine) of the old OS.**- **Finally, one can change one's perspective or workflow, in such a way that the old software is not needed any longer, but is replaced with other software of a different kind (this may actually lead to much improved workflows).****Role of conduct:** [The same as in Lemmy and Mastodon](https://mastodon.world/about): in summary, be respectful, no offensive language, no harasssment, no spam."
