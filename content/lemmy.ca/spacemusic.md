description: "For all the sounds of the future, including Synthwave, Cyberpunk, Sci Fi Metal, Space Ambient, Sci fi Soundtracks, or really anything with a sci fi theme. You can post from any source that isn't a bootleg (please respect copyright -- most artists working in this space need the income). Preferably, however, bandcamp or a similar source where advertising is kept to a minimum and you have the option to directly support the artist. YouTube versions should be avoided unless it is the artists' own channels, or are directly endorsed by the artist or their label. If posting Spotify, Apple Music, or similar source that requires a subscription, please try to find a subscription free alternative preferably, unless there is no option. Self-promotion is allowed, but please be transparent about it. See also: [!printsf@lemmy.ca](/c/printsf@lemmy.ca) "
