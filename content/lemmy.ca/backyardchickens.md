name: "backyardchickens"
description: "**[Were you a mod of backyard chickens on Reddit?  Message me if you're interested in modding here.]**This is a community for people who keep chickens in their back yard.  This includes pets, layers, and meaties at levels that are sub-industrial.  Family farms and homesteads are included.**EDIT**The Fediverse is small.  There probably aren't enough people here to make up a community for every type of bird that someone might keep so for now, everyone is welcome.  Bring us your ducks and geese, turkeys and quail, Guineas and Peacocks, emus and parrots.  The community will be focused on chickens but until there are enough of each bird community for their own community they will find care and comfort here.**/EDIT**There may be discussions of animal processing.  This is part of chicken keeping.  If you don't like it leave and block the community.**You may also be interested in:**[Homestead](/c/Homestead@lemmy.ca)[Parrots](/c/parrots@lemmy.world)  [Cockatiel](/c/cockatiel@lemmy.world) **RULES:**1. All Lemmy.ca rules apply here.2. Everyone (see rules 4 and 98) is welcome.3. If you've seen a question 100 times answer it the 101st time or ignore it.  Even better, write a complete, detailed answer and suggest that the mod(s) pin it to the community.4. There will be ZERO tolerance for shaming, brigading, harassment, or other nonsense of those who keep and process chickens.  You will be permanently banned the first time.5.  No, it's not a calcium deficiency.  Wrinkled eggs are the result of insufficient or insufficiently viscous albumen.  Tiny eggs and missing shells are misfires.  They happen.6.  If you post a picture that includes a dead animal or blood mark it NSFW.  We're not going to tolerate the militant anti-hunting and anti-farming bullshit here but we're also not going to tolerate people rubbing their hunting and harvesting in people's faces.  See rule 98.  If you post blood, gore, or dead animals and don't mark it NSFW it will be removed and you might be banned.[Did you actually think there were 98 rules?]98.  Don't be a dick.  Yes, this is a catch-all rule.99. The mod(s) have the final say."
