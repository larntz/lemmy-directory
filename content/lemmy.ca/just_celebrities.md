description: "Lemmy Rules or LeakALL Lemmy.ca and Fediverse wide rules apply here. POST NO LEAKS.**Female Celebrities**This community is for high quality pictures of adult female celebrities. The celebrities face must be visible, at least enough for identification.Porn stars are NOT celebrities unless they have broken into the mainstream. Tracy Lords, Sasha Grey, and the half dozen who were in Game of Thrones are examples. ONLY photos after they joined the mainstream and non-porn images are acceptable.**Full Name**Include the full name of the celebrity in the title. It doesn't matter if it's obvious. It doesn't matter if everyone should know. Put the FULL name in the title or your post will be removed.TikTok/Instagram/YouTube/Twitch/etc. handles are NOT FULL NAMES. See the rule about Social Media Personalities.**Social Media Personality**Instagrammers, YouTubers, TikTokers, models, etc. are not celebrities unless they are celebrities in their own right outside of social media. One IMDb credit as, Girl willing to show her tits. does not make a social media user a celebrity. Sextape famous is not celebrity. Sextape famous once removed is definitely not celebrity.**Washed up, coked out, fame whores.**No Kardashians, Jenners, or Thornes.**No Plastic**No plastic and especially no plastic in the ocean. Fake tits and sausage lips do not belong in this sub.**No Fakes or Lookalikes**No fakes, no overly Photoshopped images, no lookalikes, no x-rays, no bubbling, no watermarks. Deep fakes are not allowed.**No Jerkoff Posts, Comments, or Usernames**No jerkoff posts, comments, or usernames. No sadsturbation language. No Discord posts or comments. No DM for roleplay comments or posts.**Use Approved Image Host**Submissions must be from imgur or gfycat. Albums cannot exceed 25 images. Imgur link spam gets you banned.  Using image hosts that serve up garbage advertisements, scams, or malware will get you banned.**No Vulgarity**No explicit sexual comments or titles. No tits or ass titles. Offensive usernames will not be allowed to post.**No Reposts**No reposts from within the last Month. If you are reporting a repost, please include the short link of the original post. Higher resolution pictures are still reposts. If you repost your own content you will be banned. Reposting top content repeatedly will lead to a ban.**Multiple Violations**This applies to all rules, please NOTE that repeated violations of any of our rules and Lemmy.ca/Fediverse set-rules can and will eventually lead to accounts being banned from this community.Note also that there is no guarantee that you will get multiple chances. If the mods are having a bad day or you're obviously just trolling or harassing you may be permanently banned immediately.**Don't be a Dick**Don't be a dick.This is a catch-all rule that lets the moderators ban anyone who is being a dick.**Moderators have the Final Say**The moderator(s) have the final say in all matters. If you're breaking the rules or being a dick the moderators can ask you to stop, can delete your posts or comments, can remove your right to post or comment, or can ban you. The mods have the final say in all matters. There is no right of appeal though you may apologize and assure the mods that you will follow the rules and/or not be a dick and they may at their sole discretion give you another chance or they may not."
