Do not violate the [lemmy.ca server rules](https://lemmy.ca). ### Recommendations1. To help others decide whether to buy or download these apps, make a reply and share what you know, including:   - the merits of the app   - compatibility issues with different Android devices   - similar apps that you prefer   - historical pricing data if known2. If you see a sale has expired, please reply with the word “Expired” so the poster knows to change the title.3. If the sale has expired but you think the app is worth paying full price, please say so. We like sales, but we also want developers to be fairly compensated for good work."
