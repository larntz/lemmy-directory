[Community] rules and bannable offenses:1) Posting links to ROMs and other pirated content will not be tolerated. All other piracy such as linking to ROM sites is encouraged.2) Don't be a dick. Instead, be excellent to each other.Offenses will earn warnings, temporary bans, or permabans at the discretion of the moderators, as well as removal of offending post or comment.Posting spoilers:If you are posting a major (or even potential) game spoiler, please use spoiler tags [by highlighting the text and then pressing the triangle with an exclamation mark button.]Adding a link flair to your post:The link flairs available are pretty self-explanatory but to avoid confusion:[Question] - For emulation related questions about software or hardware or general emulation related questions[Solved] - For questions that have been answered.[News] - For announcements/discussion about new emulator releases/updates[Fan Content] - For all the emulator meta content, like shaders, skins, Front end customization.[Discussion] - For every other on-topic subject that doesn't really fit in any of the other categories[Meme] - For memes"
