description: "To remember: once they add flairs to the platform create those flairs: monster/horror/elemental/dragon/creature (for less dangerous beings)/spirit/(behemoth/giant/leviathan)Numbers in posts where I include pixiv in the title are id's of the artwork and the creator on platform https://www.pixiv.net/en/ . I don't include names of the artists and artworks because artworks were downloaded with use of a crawler and I thought it would make it easier to trackdown the artwork/artist on the site with id's instead of names. _p0, _p1, _p2 etc. after artwork id's are pages that tell you which artwork it is when this upload contained multiple artworks."
