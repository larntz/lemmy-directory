description: "My favourite mecha animes that I recommend to everyone that's interested in mechas:- Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch- Evangelion (movies)- Macross Zero (only this season, the rest of the series is very bad IMO)- Aldnoah.ZeroNumbers in posts where I include pixiv in the title are id's of the artwork and the creator on platform https://www.pixiv.net/en/ . I don't include names of the artists and artworks because artworks were downloaded with use of a crawler and I thought it would make it easier to trackdown the artwork/artist on the site with id's instead of names. _p0, _p1, _p2 etc. after artwork id's are pages that tell you which artwork it is when this upload contained multiple artworks."
