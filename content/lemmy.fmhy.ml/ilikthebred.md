description: "Inspired by u/a_poem_for_your_sprog's seminal series of poems. Post a picture of an animal, and a short, misspelled poem from the animal's perspective.Generally, the poems should be in iambic tetrameter, rhyming on every second line. That means each line should be four syllables / beats, and you rhyme every eighth syllable / beat."
