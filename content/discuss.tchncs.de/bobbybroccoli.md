description: "A fan community dedicated to appreciating the work of BobbyBroccoli.## The Rules1. Keep everything at least related to BB (Discussing science fraud and other animators who use this style is cool. Anime and D&D, not so much)2. You can swear, just censor it. F**k is fine. You know what's not.3. Stay civil. Related political discussions are fine, but just stay chill.4. No NSFW stuff.5. Don't just sh*t on people. Doesn't matter if it's BB or a user here, play nice.## Links-  [The Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BobbyBroccoli)-  [The Broccumentary Master List](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAB-wWbHL7VskQmC4rUG8vwSUSjG83z-I)"
