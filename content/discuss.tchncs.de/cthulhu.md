Anything not related to the setting or rules of Cthulhu TTRPGs is off-topic here.- This community is not about adult/NSFW/NSFL stuff, keep it clean.- No piracy / violation of copyright laws.- Self-promoting your CoC/Delta Green/etc community content is fine - as long as these promotions do not overwhelm the community.- Affiliate links are not wanted.Additional rules that are not listed here right now can be added and enforced at any time without prior notification if we feel that it is required to protect to community and its members."
