description: "Post copies of Joker's Patch Pack and newgrf content that is, or is derived from, artists with stingy copyright notices on mods for an open source game. Why? Because the end user shouldn't have to suffer the spite of groups like the Simuscape founders, or individuals like OzTrans and SilverSurferZzZ, over the actions of a few core members of TT-Forums."
