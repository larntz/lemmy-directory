description: "An international (English speaking) socialist lemmy community free of the ML influence of instances like lemmy.ml and lemmygrad. This is a place for undogmatic and constructive discussion of current events from a progressive, anti-capitalist and truly anti-imperialist perspective, regardless of specific ideology. A certain knowledge of socialism is expected, if you are new to/interested in socialism, please visit [c/Socialism101](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/actualsocialism101) (still under construction) before participating here. Socialism101 will gladly help you by answering questions, providing resources etc. Memes go in [c/Lefty Memes](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/leftymemes)**Rules****1. Socialist Unity in the form of mutual respect and good faith discussion is enforced here.**Try to keep an open mind, other schools of thought may offer points of view and analyses you haven't considered yet. Also: This is not a place for the Idealism vs. Materialism or rather Marxism vs. Anarchism debate(s), for that please visit [c/AnarchismVsMarxism](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/anarchismvsmarxism) (still under construction)**2. Anti-Imperialism means recognizing capitalist states like Russia and China as such**,as well as condemning (their) imperialism, even if is of the anti-USA flavor.**3. No liberalism, (right-wing) revisionism or reactionaries.**That includes so called: Social Democracy, Democratic Socialism, Dengism, Market Socialism, Patriotic Socialism, National Bolshevism, Anarcho-Capitalism etc. Anti-Socialist people and content have no place here, as well as the variety of Marxist-Leninists seen on lemmygrad (actual ML's are welcome as long as they agree to the rules and don't just copy paste/larp about stuff from a hundred years ago).**4. No Bigotry.**The only dangerous minority is the rich.**4. Don't demonize previous and current socialist experiments or (leading) individuals.**We must constructively learn from their mistakes, while acknowledging their achievements and recognizing when they have strayed away from socialist principles.**5. Don't idolize/glorify previous and current socialist experiments or (leading) individuals.**Notable achievements in all spheres of society were made by various socialist/people's/democratic republics around the world. Mistakes, however, were made as well: bureaucratic castes of parasitic elites - as well as reactionary cults of personality - were established, many things were mismanaged and prejudice and bigotry sometimes replaced internationalism and progressiveness."
