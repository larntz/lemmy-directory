See the [Lemmy Code of Conduct](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/code_of_conduct.html) and the TOS of [feddit.de](https://feddit.de/).4. **Be respectful and kind** — Everyone should feel welcome here. Behaviour like doxxing, stalking, brigading, dogpiling, mobbing, deliberate misgendering or deadnaming will not be tolerated.5. **No Nazi propaganda** — including symbols like the swastika. Obviously there is a Siegrune in the bands logo and on some of Jeff's guitars, which will be tolerated *in that context*.6. **No Ads / Spamming** — Self-promotion is OK as long as it’s not excessive.7. **No porn**"
