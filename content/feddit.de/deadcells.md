description: "# About this communityDead Cells is an action/platformer/roguelite game developed by Motion Twin, a French independent developer based in Bordeaux. It's available on all current gaming platforms. This community is here for anyone wanting to discuss the game. Everyone is welcome to participate! Please read the rules before you post but don't be shy, come say hi!***# Rules::: spoiler 1. Be niceBe civil with fellow members and welcoming to new users. Don't flame, insult, harass people, etc... Avoid git gud or skill issue comments, and try to be patient with newcomers.:::***:::spoiler 2. Stay on topicOnly post Dead Cells-related content. Gifs, screenshots, discussion, suggestions, questions, memes are all welcome as long as it remains on topic and somewhat interesting to other members (see next rule).:::***:::spoiler 3. No low-effort or duplicate postsDuplicative posts about in-game occurrences (Symmetrical Lance's can break shields affix bug) or other low-effort posts will be removed.:::***:::spoiler 4. No spam, self-promotion or clickbaitPlease no ads for your youtube/twitch channel or streams here. Posting a funny clip or an incredible run is perfectly fine, but it should be interesting enough to Lemmy users to justify it. Just because a 2h video has a hilarious bug in it doesn't mean you should post the whole video. Caps lock clickbait titles are especially criminal. Examples of things that are not allowed: Watch me stream dead cells, Doing hard mode runs! Speed run attempts today! DEAD CELLS TWITCH GIVEAWAY!!!, etc..:::***:::spoiler 5. Posting guidelinesSee previous rules for the general idea. Be helpful to new players, try to give them good advice. Don't post methods to cheat in Daily runs. Please don't encourage newbies to cheat when they're looking for advice. No porn, gore, etc.:::"
