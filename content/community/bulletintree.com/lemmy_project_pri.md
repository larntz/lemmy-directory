description: "I've raised my voice loudly on meta communities, github, and created new [!lemmyperformance@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/lemmyperformance)  and [!lemmycode@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/lemmycode)  communities.I feel like the performance problems are being ignored for over 30 days when there are a half-dozen solutions that could be coded in 5 to 10 hours of labor by one person.I'll toss it into this echo chamber."
