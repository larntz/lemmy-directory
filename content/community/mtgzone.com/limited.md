description: "**Discussion for all Limited formats**Sealed deck, booster draft, cube draft, and other limited variants are all welcome here! Limited formats require live deckbuilding from a random pool of cards you open, as opposed to Constructed deckbuilding where you bring a deck you've created ahead of time.Read more about [booster draft](https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/booster-draft), [sealed deck](https://magic.wizards.com/formats/sealed-deck), [Conspiracy](https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/conspiracy), and [team limited events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/team-booster-draft)."
