description: "#### Commander format discussionAlso called **EDH** or Elder Dragon Highlander, Commander is Magic's most popular format and all about picking your hero and building a deck around them. In this casual, multiplayer format, you choose a legendary creature to serve as your commander and build the rest of your 100 card deck around their color identity and unique abilities. Players are only allowed one of each card in their deck, with the exception of basic lands, but they can use cards from throughout Magic's history.Commander combines the command zone, color identity, singleton deckbuilding, multiplayer strategies, and the entire MtG cardpool for one of the most exciting and fresh ways to play.Read more at [Commander's official website](https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/commander).---"
