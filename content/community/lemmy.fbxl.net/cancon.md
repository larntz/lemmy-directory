description: "With Bill C-11 and Bill C-18, we need to make sure we promote Canadian content before the CRTC comes in and mandates we do, but we also need to make sure not to utilize any establishment news sources because I can't afford to pay big media companies for hyperlinks on an internet website.I'm sure we'll have a lot of positive things to say about the ruling regime that passed those laws regulating the internet."
