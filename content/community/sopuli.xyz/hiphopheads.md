Use proper title formatDo not make up post tags. New releases should be tagged [FRESH], [FRESH ALBUM] (or MIXTAPE) or [FRESH VIDEO] only. [FRESH] tags should only be applied to official music & music videos, not leaks, interviews, articles, art, live footage, etc. [SHOTS FIRED] should only be used for legitimate beef, not jokes or competition among artists.Song posts must follow the 'Artist - Title (Description)' format with 80 character or less descriptions.
