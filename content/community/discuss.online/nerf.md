description: "Welcome, Nerfers! This is a place for Nerf, Modifications, Homemades, Assassins, Office wars, Humans vs. Zombies, BoomCo, Off-brands, Water Blasters . . . We're intended to be like /r/nerf except [not dependent on reddit.](https://wiki.discuss.online/view/Where_we_came_from)We're still setting things up, but we're ready for what's truly important: you to share builds, news, advice, and stories. ::: spoiler Are you new to Lemmy? Please click here to expand.Lemmy is a lot like reddit. For most purposes you can treat it as if it *is* reddit.The main difference is that when you view your front page or search for other communities, you have a choice between subscribed (what you've already joined), local (a small subset of communities) and all (every community that this server knows about). discuss.online is one of many Lemmy servers and many of the communities that you see here originate on other servers - but this networking is handled behind the scenes. This decentralization makes Lemmy resilient but you can still use it just like reddit. [A longer explanation can be found here.](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/users/01-getting-started.html):::# Community standardsWe maintain a higher standard of civility here than an average forum. Please be nice, and be forgiving: the other guy might be literally a kid. We have [moderate post quality standards](https://wiki.discuss.online/view/Nerf_post_quality) here; [nerfchatter](https://discuss.online/c/nerfchatter) is very lax. If you'd like to ask a question, **please try googling it first**. We have some idiosyncratic rules (next section) including topics that we direct elsewhere (what we aren't). Please take a minute to read them before posting. It’s “blaster/dart,” not “gun/bullet” - because the latter [can lead to things](https://wiki.discuss.online/view/Why_we_say_%22blaster%22_on_Nerf_and_Nerf_chatter) that we'd rather avoid. This is a common mistake, but it is a mistake. Similarly, it's good to be clear that realistic blasters shouldn't be used in public spaces for the benefit of our young readers.# Community rules* Don’t spam (post excessively) or excessively self-promote. That means at most 1 post per day, and less than 1/10ths of your posts and comments each may be self-promotion. * No [low effort](https://wiki.discuss.online/view/Nerf_post_quality) content.* Only post thrift finds on Thursday - where Thursday starts at 1AM GMT-07 and runs for 24 hours. This corresponds to daylight Thursday for most of our readers. * Don’t recommend or show dangerous practices, [such as these](https://wiki.discuss.online/view/Nerf_safety_rules). There is to be absolutely no deliberate weaponization, even as a joke or against nonhuman targets. * Pirated/knockoff versions of hobby-made designs should not be shared; don’t give pirates free advertising. * Respect community standards (above) and stay on-topic (below).# What we aren’t* 3d printing questions not specific to nerf should go on 3d printing communities. * You can buy/sell/trade/“what’s it worth?” on /r/nerfexchange (though we may make an exchange Lemmy community later).* No scripted battle footage. We have to ban this so that we don’t get flooded with it. This is very easy to find on YouTube if you for some reason want to see it. * No memes/jokes; there may be rare exceptions for discussions of ongoing events. Again, we have to ban this to not be flooded by it. Memes/jokes are very welcome at [Nerfchatter](https://discuss.online/c/nerfchatter).# Tags::: spoiler We're going to have tags when the search function on which they depend is up and running. Tagging makes your post easier for people to find, although it’s not required. You can tag a post by including a tag (including the square brackets) anywhere in the title. (Click to expand to see the planned list of tags.)As a rule of thumb, we suggest that tags higher on this list take priority if more than one could apply. **Resources**[[help]](https://discuss.online/search?q=%5Bhelp%5D&type=All&listingType=Local&communityId=978&page=1&sort=New) - Asking for advice.
