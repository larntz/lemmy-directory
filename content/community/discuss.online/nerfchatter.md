description: "We're under construction and locked for now. Hopefully not for long. This is a companion community to [nerf](https://discuss.online/c/nerf), with about half as many rules. So long as it’s at least vaguely related to nerf, not spam, and not actively bad for the community - go ahead and share it here. Memes and jokes? We encourage them!That blaster you just got for Christmas? Sure, why not?That thrift haul that you want to post *now*, dangit? Great!With that being said: * We’re still good people here; keep it civil. * We still ban anything that’s bad for the community: [unsafe modification](https://wiki.discuss.online/view/Nerf_safety_rules), pirated hobby-made designs, spam, and weaponization. We still stand by “it’s a blaster, not a gun” for [reasons](https://wiki.discuss.online/view/Why_we_say_%22blaster%22).* The one thing that we’re stricter about than nerf is self-promotion. This just isn’t the place for it. (And if we see scripted battle videos, we will assume that OP is promoting their own channel.)"
