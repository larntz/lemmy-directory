description: "A community for everyone who works with microcontrollers from SOT23-6 PICs and ATTINYs to PICs, STMs, and ESPs.  All microcontrollers and all users are welcome here.  If you're just starting out, read some posts and ask some questions.  If you're building cool projects post picture and share your work.  If you're a professional tell us about your project and answer questions.  Blog posts and updates are encouraged.  Let's talk about programming languages, IDEs, and programmers.  Post code, schematics, and board layouts.**You may also be interested in:**!arduino@lemmy.caRULES:All Lemmy.ca rules apply here.1. Everyone (see rule 98) is welcome.2. If you’ve seen a question 100 times answer it the 101st time or ignore it. Even better, write a complete, detailed answer and suggest that the mod(s) pin it to the community.3. There is no best microcontroller, language, IDE, or programmer, only what works best for you.  There will be no elitist bullshit here.  See rule 98.[Did you actually think there were 98 rules?]98. Don’t be a dick. Yes, this is a catch-all rule.99. The mod(s) have the final say."
