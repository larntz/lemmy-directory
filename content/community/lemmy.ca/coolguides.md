description: "Defining a Guide-Guides are reference materials, how-tos, and/or comparison tables. It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.Defining An Infographic-An infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides.**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey** These are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts.

Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.Lastly always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything we do not always moderate for accuracy though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments.Rules-**Direct links to images**Only direct links to images of type .png, jpg, and .jpeg are allowed**Infographics will be removed**An infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures.
