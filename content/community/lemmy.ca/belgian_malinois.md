description: "Maligator. Land shark. â…” of a German Shepherd on crack cocaine. No matter what you call these crazy dogs, this is the place to ask questions or share your love of them!Postings of training seminars or any other type of group events are acceptable as long as you have the physical location in square brackets at the beginning of the post title, eg: [Vernon, BC] and clearly & comprehensively state any fee schedules within the body of the post.Note: there will be no pushback, censorship, or censure against balanced training here. You are free to use positive-only training yourself, and to recommend such techniques to others. But for any high-drive dog (as Mals are bound to be), balanced training is frequently the only thing standing between them and the behavioural euthanization table. There will be no suppression of balanced training techniques/advice unless it is clearly abusive and/or excessive."
