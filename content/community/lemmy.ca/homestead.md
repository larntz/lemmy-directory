All Lemmy.ca rules apply here.2. Everyone (see rules 4 and 98) is welcome.3. If you've seen a question 100 times answer it the 101st time or ignore it.  Even better, write a complete, detailed answer and suggest that the mod(s) pin it to the community.4. There will be ZERO tolerance for shaming, brigading, harassment, or other nonsense of those who keep, hunt, harvest, and process animals.

If you post a picture that includes blood, gore, or a dead animal mark it NSFW.  We're not going to tolerate the militant anti-hunting and anti-farming bullshit here but we're also not going to tolerate people rubbing their hunting and harvesting in people's faces.  [See rule 98.]  If you post blood, gore, or dead animals and don't mark it NSFW it will be removed.[Did you actually think there were 98 rules?]98.  Don't be a dick.  Yes, this is a catch-all rule.  Yes, you absolutely can be permanently banned for Rule 98 violations.99. The mod(s) have the final say."
