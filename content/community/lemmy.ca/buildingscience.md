It traditionally includes the detailed analysis of building materials, building envelope, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, natural and electrical lighting, acoustic, indoor air quality, passive strategies, fire protection, and renewable energies and reduced carbon in buildings.**General Rules**- Don't expect free consulting. This is a field people get paid to work in and that work is valuable.- Do keep posts in the realm of building science and keep debate civil.- Promote innovation and don't dismiss ignorance. Sometimes your knowledge may be the keystone to assisting someone else's breakthrough.- Challenge opinions with verifiable information such as case studies and avoid anecdotes.- Talking about what your company does is fine, but please no self-promoting services."
