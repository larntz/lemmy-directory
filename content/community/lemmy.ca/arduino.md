description: "A community for people who use Arduino boards and the Arduino IDE.  Everyone is welcome here whether you use genuine Arduino hardware with the Arduino IDE, or clone boards, or other programming languages.  If it involves Arduino hardware or software it's welcome here.  If it connects to Arduino hardware it's welcome here.  IF you're building your own boards that you use with an Arduino it's welcome here.  There will be no Arduino elitist bullshit in this community.Rules:1. It's always a floating input.2.  Be nice to noobs.  We all start somewhere and we all made the common mistakes.  If you see a question asked 100 times answer it the 100th time or ignore it.  Don't be a dick."
