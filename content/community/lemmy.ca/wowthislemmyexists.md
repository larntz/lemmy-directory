Starting next week however we're going to ask you to move such posts to more appropriate forums such as  !lemmy_support@lemmy.ml , or !kbinMeta@kbin.social**Rules**1. Don't be a jerk or be deliberately unhelpful2. Post title _should_ include the community name as one would type it into the community search, with instance name preferred.3. post content should elaborate more specifically what/for whom the community is about 4. Please no NSFW communities -if you want to create /c/wowthisNSFW exists go right ahead.5. No posting of personal information6. No joke, troll, or deliberately misleading requests, suggestions or posts   7. no SPAM"
