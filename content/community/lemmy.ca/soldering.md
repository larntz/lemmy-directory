description: "This community is for electronic hobbyists to discuss projects and is focused on soldering.  Everyone is welcome from the noob to people who have been soldering as a hobby for decades to people who solder professionally.  We'll talk about materials and techniques, equipment, and projects.  Everyone is welcome.  All questions are welcome.  Post photos and ask for help.Rules:1. Be nice to noobs.  Everyone starts with a single solder joint, often a bad one, and we have all made the same mistakes.  If you see the same question asked 100 times answer it the 100th time or ignore it.  Don't be a dick to noobs."
