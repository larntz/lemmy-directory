description: "This is a community to discuss the housing crisis in Canada.All so Canadians can find a decent home to live in. Racism is still absolutely prohibited, but you are welcome to debate population growth, immigration rate, foreign home buyers, and the merits of single family homes or the green zone. A merge of r/canadahousing and r/canadahousing2 for those coming from Reddit. Bits of the sidebar and logo taken from those subs and will be going through a slight revision as things get settled."
