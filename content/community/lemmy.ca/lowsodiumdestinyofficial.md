description: "Welcome to the OFFICIAL Low Sodium Destiny community on Lemmy-operated by the original mods of the other place.We exist as a place to promote positive discussion of and about Destiny 2 and its universe.Post that Trials clutch play, or a hilarious video of how you slammed your friend into the wall with your Sparrow.Tell us your favorite raid experience, or that one time in Iron Banner that you completely decimated the other team.This is a free and open discussion forum for what you love about Destiny.RULES:**Rule 1: No Memes/Low Effort Posts-** Any topics posted here on that are just for the lulz will be removed. The occasional dad-joke is fine, but have a clear idea of what constitutes as a low quality or low effort post. Also, please give your posts some sort of context that can be discussed. Single links or opinions with no explanations to them will also be taken down. We have a Meme Board on our Discord server where you can post until heart's content.**Rule 2: No Controversial Topics-** Discussing topics that can be deemed controversial, such as articles/videos that don't give information but rather are simply subjective opinions, rants and complaints is a no-no. Clearly that's not what people want in this sub. We're here to discuss things that we enjoy about Destiny, and get updates about the game in a hate free environment. Opinion topics are fine, so long as they result in constructive (non-salty) discussions. Mods can remove such posts at their discretion.**Rule 3: Zero Tolerance on trolls and shitposts-** Any blatantly negative comments or posts, trolling and low-effort posts will result in a permanent ban from the sub. We will not tolerate any form of negative communication here. There will be lowlifes who join just to troll with negative comments and topics. You're encouraged to report such postings ASAP, and they will be dealt with equally ASAP.**Rule 4: Be nice, or leave!-** Simple as that. Just go with the ol' adage If you can't say somethin' nice, don't say anythin' at all. (Thanks Thumper). We can't reiterate enough that this is a place for constructively, lively discussion. If such a discussion decays down to arguing and insulting, be it directly or passive aggressively, actions will be take up to and including topic removals and/or permanent bans.**Rule 5: Please do NOT ask for group ups here!-** Self explanatory. Use one of the other methods to LFG for activities.  Clan Recruitment posts however will allowed as long as you get moderator approval first.**Rule 6: Flexing Posts-** Flex Posts [aka I did (insert activity here) solo, or I finally got (Insert Weapon here)!] are limited to the following activities (must show proof of the flex as well): Endgame PVE Content (clearing or soloing dungeons, master raids/dungeons, raid clear highlights), Obtaining or Gilding Titles.**Rule 7: Rule for Artists & Content Creators-** Art: If you are not the creator of the artwork being presented, you must credit them in the TOPIC Title and link to their work. Also, No AI generated art will be allowed.**Rule 8: 9:1 Rule for Content Creators-** For every single post of content from a MONETIZED platform (YouTube, Patreon, Website article that earns ad revenue, etc.), you need to have made 9 QUALITY POSTS (no low effort posts) beforehand, otherwise your content will be REMOVED. This doesn't apply to NON-MONETIZED platforms (DeviantArt, ArtStation, etc.).*"
