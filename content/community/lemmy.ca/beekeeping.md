description: "A community for learning about bees, most of the content is toward honey bees. But all little buzzers shoild be noted beacuse the honey bee varieties are not the only import bees. Well I guess wasps too, but yellow jackets are already on thin ice. Bee decent and kind, I want this community to increase the number of people that care about our A plus polinators and by extension the enviroment we all share. I know only a little about bees but I always am open to learning more!"
