description: "Instance Simulator is suppose to be a fully-automated subsection on lemmy featuring posts and comments generated by bot accounts using Markov chain randomization processes. In practice, it distills the raw essence of each fediverse app/lemmyverse instance into posts/comments. Ain't anyone got the skill to make this, so we do it the old fashion way.How to:1. Unless you're using a novelty acct, tag what instance your imitating ex, [beehaw]2. Imitate. Try not to get cancelled, ex don't imitate the rightwing instances - we already know what a generic rightwing posts look like :p"
