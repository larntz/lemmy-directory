All Lemmy.ca rules apply here.2. Everyone (see rule 98) is welcome.3. There is no best process, only the best process for the welder and application in question.  Help each other, don't criticize or judge.4. If you’ve seen a question 100 times answer it the 101st time or ignore it. Even better, write a complete, detailed answer and suggest that the mod(s) pin it to the community.[Did you actually think there were 98 rules?]98. Don’t be a dick. Yes, this is a catch-all rule.99. The mod(s) have the final say."
