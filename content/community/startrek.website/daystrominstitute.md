description: "Serious, in-depth discussion about *Star Trek.*##### **Rules****1. Explain your reasoning**All threads and comments submitted to the Daystrom Institute must contain an explanation of the reasoning put forth.    **2. No whinging, jokes, memes, and other shallow content.**This entire community has a “serious tag” on it. Shitposts are encouraged in [Risa](https://startrek.website/c/risa).    **3. Be diplomatic.**Participate in a courteous, objective, and open-minded fashion. Be nice to other posters and the people who make *Star Trek.* Disagree respectfully and don’t gatekeep.    **4. Assume good faith.**Assume good faith. Give other posters the benefit of the doubt, but report them if you genuinely believe they are trolling. Don’t whine about “politics.”    **5. Tag spoilers.** Historically Daystrom has not had a spoiler policy, so you may encounter untagged spoilers here. Ultimately, avoiding online discussion until you are caught up is the only certain way to avoid spoilers.#### **Content Regulations****6. Stay on-topic.**Threads must discuss Star Trek. Comments must discuss the topic raised in the original post.**7. We approach Star Trek as a work of fiction.**This isn't a role playing or an in-universe only subreddit. Do not ask contrived questions which have glaringly obvious real-world answers.**8. All events occur in the timeline they are presented as having occurred in.**Do not post theories that perceived inconsistencies between episodes or shows are a result of alternate universes created by time travel or any other means unless explicitly established on screen. These theories often seem clever, but they are not falsifiable and tend to come across as dismissing lesser parts of Star Trek.#### **Episode Guides**The /r/DaystromInstitute wiki held a number of popular Star Trek watch guides. We have rehosted them here: - [Kraetos’ guide to Star Trek (the original series)](https://startrek.website/post/760)- [Algernon_Asimov’s guide to Star Trek: The Animated Series](https://startrek.website/post/765)- [Algernon_Asimov’s guide to Star Trek: The Next Generation](https://startrek.website/post/768)- [Algernon_Asimov’s guide to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine](https://startrek.website/post/776)- [Darth_Rasputin32898’s guide to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine](https://startrek.website/post/772)- [OpticalData’s guide to Star Trek: Voyager](https://startrek.website/post/780)- [petrus4’s guide to Star Trek: Voyager](https://startrek.website/post/781)"
