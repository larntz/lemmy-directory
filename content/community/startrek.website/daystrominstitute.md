description: "Serious, in-depth discussion about *Star Trek.*##### **Rules****1. Explain your reasoning**All threads and comments submitted to the Daystrom Institute must contain an explanation of the reasoning put forth.    **2. No whinging, jokes, memes, and other shallow content.**This entire community has a “serious tag” on it. Shitposts are encouraged in [Risa](https://startrek.website/c/risa).    **3. Be diplomatic.**Participate in a courteous, objective, and open-minded fashion. Be nice to other posters and the people who make *Star Trek.* Disagree respectfully and don’t gatekeep.    **4. Assume good faith.**Assume good faith. Give other posters the benefit of the doubt, but report them if you genuinely believe they are trolling. Don’t whine about “politics.”    **5. Tag spoilers.** Historically Daystrom has not had a spoiler policy, so you may encounter untagged spoilers here. Ultimately, avoiding online discussion until you are caught up is the only certain way to avoid spoilers.#### **Episode Guides**The /r/DaystromInstitute wiki held a number of popular Star Trek watch guides.
