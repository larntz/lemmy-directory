description: "ENGLISH:Hi, welcome to [!askitaly](https://feddit.it/c/askitaly)! Before you post here, you might want to read the rules. Generally, there are the instance rules: - No **NSFW/NSFL** -  No **illegal content** - No **racial** or **gender discrimination** - No **spamWe understand that for some questions it may be unavoidable to touch on the topic of illegality, discrimination, or something else. For this reason, **if your question is in good faith or if it is a particular political question, your thread will not be removed regardless but will be reviewed by a mod**. The instance admins can always decide to delete your threads, regardless of the community mods.*(NOTE: this does not mean that you can post whatever you want or that threads will never be removed. A question like I did this, is this illegal? will not be removed, but How can I do this without being fined/arrested? will be blocked. That was an extreme example, but hopefully you got it).*Last but not least, titles must be explanatory, I have a question is not ok.[TRADUZIONE ITALIANA](https://pastebin.com/t0riLy5p)"
