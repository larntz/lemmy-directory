description: "Censorship is bad, and is often difficult to seek accountability for (because such attempts are themselves censored).This community exists as a safe place to report on instances and patterns of censorship among pro-GME and pro-DRS accounts.RULE: Due to the unfortunate risk of escalating tensions, moderation in this community will be limited to factual record. Please do not include commentary on presumed motivations, intentions, shillery, name-calling, etc. If such commentary is included in screenshots, it must be redacted out."
