description: "Beehaw's community for socialists, communists, anarchists, and non-authoritarian leftists of all stripes. A place for all leftist and labor news and discussion, as long as you're nice about it.---Non-socialists are welcome to come to learn,  though it's hard to get to in-depth discussions if the community is constantly fighting over the basics. We ask that non-socialists please be respectful and try not to turn this into a left vs right debate forum by asking leading questions or by trying to draw others into a fight.---This community's icon was made by Aaron Schneider, under the [CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)."
