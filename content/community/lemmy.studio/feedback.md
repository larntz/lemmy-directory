description: "Are you working on a song or just finished it and want some feedback? Post it here so we can listen and comment on it!A few ground rules:- When asking for feedback, It's generally better to mention what kind of feedback you want. Are you looking for feedback on the mix? The arrangement? Drums? (It's OK to just ask for general feedback, though.)- When giving feedback, keep the genre in mind. Even if you don't like the genre you can still give technical feedback. If you don't have technical feedback you can always just say how the song makes you feel.- Be kind, everyone was a beginner once. Most of us also thought we were amazing when we were just starting, even though that was not true. ðŸ™ƒ - To build a healthy community, don't just ask for feedback on your songs. Take some time to listen to and comment on other people's songs as well."
