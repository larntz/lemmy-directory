description: "**Sabaidee, Welcome!**This is a community for promoting sustainability in tech and computing. This includes: understanding the impact that our tech/computing choices have on the environment; purchasing or re-using devices that are sustainable and repairable; how to properly recycle or dispose of old devices when it is beyond use; and promoting software and services that allow us to reduce our environmental impact in the long term, both at work and in our personal lives.This isn't a competition, it's a reminder to stay grounded when making your decisions. Remember: The most sustainable device is the one that you are already using.**Rules**:1) Stay on-topic. Everything from sustainable smartphones to data centers and the green energy that powers them is fair game.2) Be excellent to each other.*Note*: This is hosted on Lemmy at SDF.
