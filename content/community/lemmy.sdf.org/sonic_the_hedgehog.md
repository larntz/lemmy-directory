Before you post it, ask if it would be something that could be aired on the Simpsons.No boot-licking. Whether it be a person in the community or SEGA themselves, nobody is above criticism.Do not harass anyone in or from this community. Do not plan community related activities outside the community.Do not concede from the union and begin civil war over Sonic's anatomy, or some other dumb shit.Ask a moderator before you promote yourself.Do not spoil releases until one month after release. This includes, but is not limited to endings, major plot points, game-play elements not revealed in marketing, post-credit scenes, new developments in the series as a whole (e.g. new voice actors, new characters/places), or anything that meets these descriptors but was previously leaked..Just be reasonable and use common sense.
