description: "## From Bash to Batch, Ash to Zsh; all shell languages are welcome here!### Rules:1. Follow Lemmy rules!1. Posts *must* relate to shell scripting. (See bottom of sidebar for more information.)1. Only make helpful replies to questions. This is not the place for low effort joke answers.1. No discussion about piracy or hacking.1. If you find a solution to your problem by other means, please take your time to write down the steps you used to solve your problem in the original post. You can potentially help others having the same problem!1. These rules will change as the community grows.---> I want to make a clear delineation on what is and is not allowed. From my experience on Reddit, communities in this niche were far too numerous and fractured. This community casts a fairly wide net, but intends to stay focused on the joy and pain of writing scripts.- **Allowed**: Release Announcement of a command-line program designed for scripted use (e.g. bash, bats, awk, jq, coreutils/moreutils)- **Allowed**: Tutorials on using shell languages or supplementary tools designed for scripted use- **Allowed**: Code review/help requests for shell languages or supplementary tools designed for scripted use- **NOT Allowed**: Announcement of a CLI or TUI program that is not designed for scripted use (Yes, your fancy Zsh plugin which pretty-prints the date and time using only builtins is very cool, but unless you actually want to discuss the code itself, find somewhere else to post it.)- **NOT Allowed**: Domain-specific tutorials that do not involve shell scripting as a core component (e.g. docker-compose, - **NOT Allowed**: Code review requests for non-shell programming languages and configuration languages (e.g. Python, Yaml)---In general, if your submission text is primarily shell code, then it is welcome here!"
