Format your meme correctly. No posts where the title is the meme caption!Posts must be formatted correctly. No posts where the title is the meme caption. The caption must be in the meme image, not in the submission title.Content that is not a meme at all or that does not make sense will be removed, including photos, screenshots, and blank templates. Properly crop your memes, folks.Fanart is still appreciated (who knows? if it's good enough, maybe we might consider it worthy enough to belong in a museum...)13.

Slur chains, reactionary bait, etc.Please keep political comments brief and civil, this not a place for lectures.14. Don't be a criticDo not heckle or be rude to each other. Criticism should either be constructive, or not given at all.Please show OP respect.There is no reason to announce that you hate a post. Downvotes are there for that.
