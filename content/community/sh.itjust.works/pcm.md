description: "# A refuge.The PCM subreddit is no longer on blackout, but you can still come here every time Reddit's moderators, admins, or AHS make you mad. Sadly it's not the same thing without flairs. Be nice-ish. I am just a rando, not an old PCM mod. For now, resources such as the banner are just plain stolen without permission.**Before you join, take a political compass test, like this one:**[Classic Compass Test](https://www.politicalcompass.org/test)Or this one:[IDR Compass Test](https://www.idrlabs.com/political-coordinates/test.php)![](https://sh.itjust.works/pictrs/image/338ad8fe-5bf5-496a-ac1d-e41d97dbbaa5.png)The idea of the political compass posits that rather than a linear spectrum, a person's political ideology can be described on two axes: A **left-right** axis, and a **liberal-authoritarian** axis. This creates four quadrants of broad political classifications. Some tests propose alternative and additional axes, but the absolute core value of this community is that the left-right spectrum is *NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION* to describe a person's values, and there are more than two options for you should desire your government to behave.This is a space where people with different political alignments will debate, propagandize, and mock eachother. **It's all in good fun, try to learn something from people you disagree with.**# RULES:1: Posts must be memes (images that are at least a little humorous) and must include the political compass itself, or its colors. Funny colors included for pictures where EG a person happens to be wearing a red shirt and is labeled as making a pro-communist argument. Highlighted text is allowed.2: Not an NSFW community, no NSFW content.3: Don't promote ~~too much~~ hate- please no outright calls to murder or genocide. This isn't Reddit, so you CAN make face the wall jokes or say I think pedos should be executed, but still generally keep it tasteful.4: Old PCM had a Misinformation rule? bruh. Go tell lies. Post onion articles and say they're real. We'll laugh at people who don't get it. Mods may take action if we feel like we're being invaded by organized propaganda. Or we might be too busy making memes.# Resources[Classic Compass](https://i.redd.it/hklcdjt60y531.png) [Classic Compass + Centrist](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Political_compass_ohne_Text_mit_1px_Rand_und_Quadrat-Mitte.svg/1882px-Political_compass_ohne_Text_mit_1px_Rand_und_Quadrat-Mitte.svg.png)[9x9 Compass](https://i.redd.it/og5u5u4qiv451.png)[PCM Mod's Wojak Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hI0yS5lLJzNNlCPlt_sgl-dWz57G9bV1)[More Wojaks](https://wojakparadise.net/)"
