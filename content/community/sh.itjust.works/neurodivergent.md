description: "... but differently.#### A place for sharing creativity which has that *special other dimension* to it. **Divergent folk, awakened ones, angels, prophets, inventors, and ... neurotypicals. Forget about your autism! We appreciate your awkwardness.**What is this going to be? Well, actually i know ... but i need some time to express it in *words*. ðŸ˜„  Here you may get some of the idea of this: [Creating a neurodivergent playground and art collection](https://lemmy.world/post/68168) (yep, thats my main account, in case you wonder).  I'm currently doing some inspiration collecting, here in the pinned post: https://sh.itjust.works/post/112817What this place is *not* going to be:  - A place for talking *about* autism, neurodiversity and problems associated with that, or memes about all the former. We do not want to talk about what *doesn't* work. ;-)This place however, shall be there for sharing what we (and others) can *do* with it. How we are, what we receive, and how we create when we are *in the flow*. This shall be *uplifting* and *mutually enabling*. Here we shall celebrate cheerfully our *uniqueness*.We are the bunch who perhaps *really* know how things could work *better*.For those other things, you may want to look into one of these places:  [!autism@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/autism)  [!autism@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/autism)  [!autismexperiences@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/autismexperiences)  [!austim@kbin.social](https://kbin.social/m/austim)  [!neurodivergence@beehaw.org](https://beehaw.org/c/neurodivergence)  [!neurodivergente@bolha.social](https://bolha.social/c/neurodivergente) (Brazilian, PT and EN)  You see, there is plenty of room for those problems and disabilities. :-)  "
