description: "A place for thoughts at length on individual books you have recently (hell with it, or not recently) completed.  - 1st operative word *individual.* [One book at a time, fellas.](https://imgur.com/a/8MuGw0P)- 2nd operative word *completed.* It's less compelling to discuss something you picked up and put down.- English only? I leave it to user discretion and let god sort em out. Cadite eos.- I'll fill this sidebar with more wit as it comes to me. For the moment let's just get the lights on in here."
