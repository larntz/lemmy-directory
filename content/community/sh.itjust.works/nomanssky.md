As my experience with Lemmy is in it's infancy and my experience in managing a community in general is bar none, please do give me some leeway as I get my footing. But for general rules...Rules:â€¢ No NSFWâ€¢ Treat others with respectâ€¢ Keep on topic, unless there is about the community itself or a fundamental topic that affects all Lemmy/Sh.itjust.works usersâ€¢ Please only make posts in EnglishAlso, as this is a budding experience for me, I am fully open to suggestions and/or **constructive** criticism when it comes to running a community. Also also, I use Jerboa for Lemmy which doesn't seem to have notifications, and I also won't be around 24/7 to see what's happening, so expect slow or long waits between my interactions. Hope all goes well*[16 -/- 16 -/- 16 -/- 16 -/- 16]*"
