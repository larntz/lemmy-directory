description: "**Hello interlopers of Lemmy!**This is a community for people to discuss, ask questions and show their appreciation to Hello Game's No Man's Sky. As my experience with Lemmy is in it's infancy and my experience in managing a community in general is bar none, please do give me some leeway as I get my footing. But for general rules...Rules:• No NSFW• Treat others with respect• Keep on topic, unless there is about the community itself or a fundamental topic that affects all Lemmy/Sh.itjust.works users• Please only make posts in EnglishAlso, as this is a budding experience for me, I am fully open to suggestions and/or **constructive** criticism when it comes to running a community. Also also, I use Jerboa for Lemmy which doesn't seem to have notifications, and I also won't be around 24/7 to see what's happening, so expect slow or long waits between my interactions. Hope all goes well*[16 -/- 16 -/- 16 -/- 16 -/- 16]*"
