description: "(Banner from [McMansionHell.com](https://mcmansionhell.com/) )***(Please set language to English when posting AND commenting!)***A Community about large, cheaply built, suburban homes with design flaws and a lack of architectural integrity also known as “McMansions.” On **Thursdays** we celebrate the opposite: good suburban architectural design.Based off the famous subreddit r/mcmansionhell, we will essentially do all the same here, as is over there.  Please do your best and crosspost if you need too!**We need mods!!  Please please help!**[A Short Guide](https://sh.itjust.works/post/119336)*Here are the rules:*1.  **Posts can be about ugly houses in general**2. **Post appropriately and with correct tags WITHIN the title so it is easy to search.**-->Tags: Thursday Design Appreciation or HouseTDA, Just Ugly, Shitpost, Certified McMansion™, Discussion/Debate, and Interior are available.3. **All post subjects must be single family homes**-->Only post suburban, single family homes. No apartments or duplexes, etc. The community is focused on specifically traditional suburban architecture.4. **Don't post addresses or other easily identifiable information unless it is publicly listed.**-->Keep the information about the property you are posting basic and general. However, if the home is listed on a public website you are permitted to post a link to the public listing.5. **Direct Images Only, no links please.**-->Post correctly cropped, direct images and not links to websites. Image hosting links, such as Imgur, are an exception, but we still prefer a direct image.  Zillow house page, for example, is ok if it directly links to the photos and such.6. **No Spam**-->No posting an excessive amount in a row on the same day or posting the same comment on several posts at once.  We have seen it, we just didn't react to it.  Please understand that.7. **No Screenshots**-->Crop your photos correctly.8. **Thursday is special. To celebrate that, you can post nice houses you appreciate.**Helpful links:[Kate Wagner's Guide to McMansions](https://mcmansionhell.com/101)[Architectural Guides](http://www.askthearchitect.org/architectural)"
