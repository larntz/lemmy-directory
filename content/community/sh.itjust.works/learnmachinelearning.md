description: "Welcome! This is a place for people to learn more about machine learning techniques in a practical way, discuss applications and ask questions.Example questions:- Should I use a deep neural network for my audio classification task?- I'm working with a small dataset, what can I do to make my model generalize well?- Is there a library available that implements function X in language Y?- I want to learn more about the math behind machine learning technique A, where should I start?Please do:- Be kind to new people- Post guides and tutorials that you find helpful- Link to open/free sources instead of paywalled when possiblePlease don't:- Post news articles / memes (there are other machine learning/AI communities for this)Other communities in this area:- [aiapps@lemmy.intai.tech](/c/aiapps@lemmy.intai.tech)- [guide@lemmy.intai.tech](/c/guide@lemmy.intai.tech)- [machinelearning@lemmy.ml](/c/machinelearning@lemmy.ml)- [artificial_intel@lemmy.ml](/c/artificial_intel@lemmy.ml)Similar subreddits: r/MLquestions, r/askmachinelearning, r/learnmachinelearning"
