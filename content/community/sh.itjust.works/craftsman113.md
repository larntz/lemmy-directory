Be excellent to each other.# About the SawThe Sears Craftsman 113 is one of the most common yet venerable table saws ever produced.It was manufactured for Sears, Roebuck, and Co. first by King-Seeley until 1964, and Emerson Electric thereafter until the end of it's production run in the early 1990's. At various times, the 113 was produced in cabinet and bench top varities, an 8 or 10 blade capacity, and with belt or cable/direct drive and a milled cast iron top.There are still many 113's in existence. They're not hard to find on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or the online yardsale page of your choice and can usually be acquired fairly inexpensively. With a little TLC (and maybe some upgrades) they make an excellent, versatile, and accurate woodworking tool which will probably outlast you."
