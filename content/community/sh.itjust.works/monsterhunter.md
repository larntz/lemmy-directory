Plain and simple. If it's questionable, be ready to back it up.:::***:::spoiler ðŸ“– Respect Your Fellow Hunters Greenhorns or oldhats, we all start somewhere in the series. Everyone is welcome.No racism, bigotry, flaming, trolling, or any other behavior unbecoming of a guild hunter. We're here to play and discuss Monster Hunter with like-minded folks, act like it.No game shaming: This isn't a place for title vs title arguments. Take that to steam forums or elsewhere. Compare/contrast mechanics between games, discuss what worked or didn't and how. Devolving into flame wars of MHX sucks, gib more MHY will not be tolerated.No off-meta shaming: having fun playing the game *is* the meta. Discuss strats, builds, and give suggestions, but that's all they are, suggestions.:::***:::spoiler ðŸ“– Safe-For-Work OnlySFW cosplay only: no nudes/lewdsNo Rule 34: make your own MH34U:::***:::spoiler ðŸ“– Original Art OnlyNo AI art: too easy to spam, too low effort. Attribute original artists with links, watermarks, and mentions where available. If you don't know the source, say so.If an internet sleuth finds a poster cribbing others' art as their own, that's a bannable offense.:::***:::spoiler ðŸ“š  ResourcesOfficial[MonsterHunter.com](https://www.monsterhunter.com/)[Monster Hunter Twitter](https://twitter.com/monsterhunter twitter.com/monsterhunter)Community[Kiranico Game Databases](https://kiranico.com/ kiranico.com/)[Monster Hunter Series @GG.deals](https://gg.deals/franchise/monster-hunter/ gg.deals/franchise/monster-hunter/)[Monster Hunter Gathering Hall Discord](https://discord.com/invite/monsterhunter discord.com/invite/monsterhunter)Fediverse Hunter Hubs[Lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/monsterhunter lemmy.world/c/monsterhunter)[sh.itjust.works](https://sh.itjust.works/c/monsterhunter sh.itjust.works/c/monsterhunter)[Lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/monsterhunter lemmy.ml/c/monsterhunter)[kbin.social](https://kbin.social/m/MonsterHunter kbin.social/m/MonsterHunter)[fedia.io](https://fedia.io/m/MonsterHunter fedia.io/m/MonsterHunter):::***"
