description: "## What is !cyoa?!cyoa is a community for sharing and discussing CYOA content. A CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) is a “what if” scenario containing multiple options that you, the player, choose to build a world, character, and/or story. These scenarios follow a wide variety of themes, including but not limited to genres such as fantasy or sci-fi. People that play through CYOAs commonly share their ‘builds’ in the comments section, along with an explanation of your choices. This, however, is not mandatory.CYOAs are NOT to be confused with the children’s book series of the same name.### General Rule1. Don’t be a dick.### Content Rules2. Only use PNG and JPG file extensions, Imgur, ImageChest, and interactive CYOA links (such as Neocities), and text-based posts.3. Post singular CYOAs, not collections/albums.4. Label NSFW CYOAs as such in the title. Content/trigger warnings are recommended.5. No reposts (for now).6. Keep top-level comments on-topic.7. (Optional) Try and credit the original CYOA author, if possible."
