description: "This place is now inhabited by rats of various kind. They are squatting on your property! But do not worry! They are eager to share their trash! Rats are companion animals; they die without one another. That's why I need you all to be there with me.Generally, we want this community to be a random, chaotic place in which we all can post anything we want (unless it violates the instance rules, ofc.) So join us and let's build this trash container together. We'll be the rubbish and the community will be the bin. "
