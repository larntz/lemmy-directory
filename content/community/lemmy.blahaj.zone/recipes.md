description: "Share your favorite recipes for the fediverse! DIY and Open Source Food you can compile for yourself!### Rules:1. All shared recipes should be edible and intended for human consumption.2. The recipe should be the upper main body of the text of the post, we all hate blog recipe websites with 7 paragraphs of a story about great aunt Fonda's favorite rubber scraper. If you must tell that story, save it for after the recipe.3. Recipes should be formatted to the best of your ability #-###'s make headers -'s make unorganized lists like for ingredients and to make a numbered list you just write out a number followed by a period and a space.>### Ingredients:>- ingredient 1>- ingredient 2>### Directions:>1. direction 1>2. direction 24. Recipes should be as in line with the Open Source Food philosophy as possible. Avoid store bought or specific brands of products or using specific packages (I.e. 1 bag Kraft Cheddar) as ingredients unless necessary to the integrity of the dish. This allows a more consistently reproducible end product by a wider variety of people, and future proofs your recipes in the events that shrinkflation or product discontinuation affects availability."
