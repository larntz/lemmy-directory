Any posts and comments that ask for, link to, or refer sites for illegal downloads will be removed. We’re here to have fun, not to get into legal trouble!- **Always credit the original creators.** - We do not condone plagiarism. If you are not the original creator of whatever you are posting, you must credit the creator with a link to the original post, or it will be removed.- **No duplicate threads or posts** - To reduce clutter and spam, please do not make duplicate posts. Any duplicate threads will be removed. You can use the search function to look through all relevant threads and posts. If you are reacting to a reccurent bug or an announcement, please reply to the original post instead of making your own.

Hardcore explicit NSFW is not allowed -- this tag should be used in cases where it may be suggestive content that you may not want your parent/teacher/boss to see, but isn't explicit.- **Please avoid the following *Topics to Avoid***### Topics To AvoidSometimes content may be so popular on this community that they toe the line between funny and overused. Sometimes there is content that will cause drama whenever it gets posted. If you post any of the following content, your post may be removed to keep this subreddit fresh and wholesome.#### Posts that cause toxic comments- **Complaining about toxic fan behaviour.** Conflict or drama between users, especially those on a different platform, does not merit discussion here.- **Pile-on Negativity.** This encompasses threads such as Unpopular opinions and What I don't like about [unit/character]. Let's be considerate to the fans of characters and units that you may not be the fondest of.- **Ranking Characters/Songs/Units.** There are different strokes for different folks. Your opinion is not representative of the entire fandom. No one needs to know how you specifically rank them.- **Problematic and triggering content.** This community is meant to be a safe space to share informations and help each other. Please remember not everyone is comfortable with overly dark humour or triggering matters, even if it's about fictional characters. #### Posts that are repetitive- **Generic Questions.** This includes questions like Who is your favourite character/unit/song? There is a multitude of posts already asking such questions. Please contribute your response to these threads instead. - **Images created in generators.** Including but not limited to Tiermaker and avatar/character generators.#### Posts that are low-effort- **Tier Lists.** It does not take a lot of effort to drag and drop 49 characters into a few tiers. There are other ways to present your thoughts on why and how a group of characters belong in a particular category.- **AI-Generated Content.** AIs are often created from source material that were sourced without permission from the original creators. Creating 'content' with AI tools also does not involve as much effort as creating it all on your own. We want this subreddit to be a place where original works and effort are celebrated."
