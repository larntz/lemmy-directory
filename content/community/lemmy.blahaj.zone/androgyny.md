description: "A community for people who identify or present as androgynous.Androgyny is a non-binary gender identity in between male and female. Someone who identifies as androgynous might present with both masculine and feminine characteristics, or with no gender presentation at all. This community is for those who identify or present as androgynous, or would like to.***Rules*****1. No harrassment**Harassment of anyone on this community will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, making insulting, demeaning, inflammatory, or otherwise derogatory statements against a person. This includes both in the subreddit comments, and in DMs. Do not send someone unsolicited DMs without asking them in the community first.**2. Be respectful, especially of gender identity and sexual orientation**People of all gender identities, sexual orientations, racial backgrounds, and ethnic groups are welcome in this sub. Be kind to each other, and respect diversity.**3. Only post gender me requests for photos of yourself**Gender is personal, and is nobody else's business to judge, unless invited to. Gender me posts are allowed, but please only request the community to gender photos of yourself.**4. Do not assume a person's gender, unless explicitly asked for in a post**As our community is made up of a diverse collection of people with different gender identities, please do not assume someone's gender, unless they are explicitly asking for this in a post. We have seen a lot of incidents of this being weaponised by trolls, and it can cause dysphoria in trans members of our community, so please keep opinion's on how well someone passes to yourself unless asked.**5. Do not post sexually explicit content**As an inclusive community that welcomes people of all ages (not just 18+), it is important that content posted here is suitable for minors. Please do not post sexually explicit content on this community.**6. Tag potentially upsetting content as NSFW**If you feel like a post might need a content or trigger warning, please tag it as NSFW. This acts as a courtesy to people who might be upset or triggered by a certain subject, and allows them to choose whether or not they would like to see it."
