title: "Evangelical" 
name: "evangelical"
description: "A community for evangelical Christians. Evangelical is here used to describe a theological framework and movement that spans many denominations.In broad terms, evangelicals affirm:1) The Nicene creed as a human-made, but biblically-sound explanation and summary of Christian orthodoxy.2) The ultimate authority of the Bible, which is the inerrant word of God.3) The need for a personal experience of salvation or new birth for the forgiveness of sins and the inheritance of eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.4) That salvation is obtained by God's grace alone through faith alone in the person and work of Jesus Christ alone, who died for our sins on the cross and rose again for us on the third day.More could be added, but I want to keep the community fairly open.This is a place to share thoughts and ask questions. It can be something from your Bible study, or a book you have been reading. It can be devotional or academic. We can discuss church history, denominations or cultural issues.Questions and perspectives from non-evangelicals are welcome, but all posts are at the discretion of the moderator.I hope that if a few people find this community, that we can build it together to our mutual encouragement in the faith, and to the glory of God.Things which may be removed or result in a ban (WIP)- Criticism or ridicule that is not specific, constructive and considerate (in the opinion of the moderator)If you enjoy this community, then you may consider joining [reformed](https://vlemmy.net/c/reformed@lemm.ee) as wellCommunity Icon:[Bible icons created by Freepik - Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/bible)"
