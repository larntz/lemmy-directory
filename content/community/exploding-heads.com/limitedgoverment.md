description: "Government has grown too big. - It tries to do too much, but does nothing well. - It costs too much placing undue burden on those it is meant to serve. - The public servants it employs have elevated themselves to our lord and master.- it has no moral compass, it is out of control. It is time to limit government to:- the things only it can do, and- only those things it has proven it can do well in a cost efficient manner. "
