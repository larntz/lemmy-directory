description: "Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.**WARNING:**Investing in NFTs, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and these links and discussions are not recommendations by Exploding Heads or the writer to invest in NFTs, cryptocurrencies or other ICOs. Since each individual's situation is unique, a qualified professional should always be consulted before making any financial decisions.
