description: "The adoption of Ethereum-based applications - and decentralized solutions in general - depends on scaling transaction throughput, transactions per second, latency, connectivity to API-based wallets, cost-effectiveness, seamless messaging between chains, and much more.Using an execution layer solution like the SKALE Network is highly effective for building and scaling Ethereum-based applications, ranging from games to decentralized finance to productivity, media applications, and everything in between.The SKALE network supports an unlimited number of independent blockchains with zero gas fees, instant finality, and high transaction throughput. SKALE is the first live blockchain with Linear Scaling. As more nodes join the network, the capacity of the network also grows.SKALE's advanced cryptography and pooled security model enables speed and decentralization without sacrificing security, allowing developers to deliver an exceptional experience to end-users free of any gas fees or latency.https://skale.space/"
