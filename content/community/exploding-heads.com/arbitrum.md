description: "Arbitrum is a L2 solution which utilizes a technology known as optimistic rollup.This enables Ethereum smart contracts to scale by passing messages between smart contracts on the Ethereum primary chain and Arbitrumâ€™s L2 chain, with the bulk of transaction processing completed on the L2 chain. What this enables essentially is a dramatically improved performance in terms of speed and efficiency. There are 3 main components in the Arbitrum system â€” (i) the compiler, (ii) the EthBridge, and (iii) validators. These 3 components work in sync to enable Arbitrum to be fast and interoperable.[Website](https://arbitrum.io/)"
