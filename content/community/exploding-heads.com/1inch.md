title: "Crypto - 1inch (1INCH)" 
name: "1inch"
description: "1Inch is a network that connects multiple decentralized exchanges (DEX) into one unified platform. 1Inch exchange allows users to compare and optimize their crypto trades and swaps without going through every exchange separately. The platform is unique because 1Inch splits the order and uses APIs to find the best possible route for a token swap. This way, the 1Inch protocol aims to offer the best possible rates to users. An API (application program interface) is a collection of protocols and software-building applications. Providing security and lowering gas fees are among the main objectives of the 1Inch network.
