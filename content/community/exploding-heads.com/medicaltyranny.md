We cannot fix everything (though we do some things marvelously well), nor can our patients â€” no matter how intelligent or attentive â€” prevent all disease and death.If we redefine health, I hope we can discover a definition that **does not include a medical or social mandate to control peopleâ€™s behavior** for the sake of their mortal bodies; this would seem to me particularly compelling in a nation founded on the belief that one should not legislate behavior even for the sake of the immortal soul.Dr. Fitzgerald 1994"
