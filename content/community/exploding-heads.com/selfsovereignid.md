description: "Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is like a physical wallet, but digital. It holds strong digital credentials given to you by orginizations you deal with â€” digital versions of the same physical credentials you already have â€” that you can choose to share with others. Unlike an Apple or proprietary wallet, no one else can see it, change it, or take it away; the wallet and credentials inside are yours, and you can move them off your device or from device to device.With Self-sovereign identity (SSI), the power to control personal data resides with the individual, and not an administrative third party granting or tracking access to these credentials (Not Facebook, Google, et.al.).
