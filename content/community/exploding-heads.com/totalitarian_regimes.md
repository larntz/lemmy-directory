name: "totalitarian_regimes"
description: "Over the past century or so, hundreds of millions of people have died at the hands of Totalitarian Regimes & Dictators - mostly of a Socialist, Communist, or Marxist nature e.g.- Russia - Lenin, Stalin, etc & Marxists- China - Mao & Communists- Germany - Hitler & the National Socialists- Cuba - Castro & Communists- Cambodia - Pol Pot & Communists- Venezuela - Chavez & CommunistsSadly the list continues to grow - look at what is happening in Brazil today under their new regime. In the USA today, many people in government and the ruling class openly call themselves Socialists, Communists, and or Marxists.Socialism, Communism, & Marxism are all at the same end of the spectrum. Socialism is often a softer, gentler term used in the beginning, but the end point is all too similar.Proponents of these philosophies often say Socialism, Communism, or Marxism have never truly being properly implemented and they would do it properly. Really? How many attempts do you need and how many more people need to die.The purpose of this community is to discuss the underlying conditions and causes that allowed these Totalitarian Regimes to come to power. Maybe by identifying and addressing these issues, we can prevent the rise of Totalitarian Regimes in the future.This community is not a place to:- attack people based on race, religion, or ethnicity - denial of other genocides like the Holocaust- to call for violence"
