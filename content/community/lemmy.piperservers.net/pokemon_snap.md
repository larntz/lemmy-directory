description: "Share pictures from *Pok√©mon Snap* on N64 and *New Pok√©mon Snap* on Switch. Share any content you like that is related to Pok√©mon Snap without violating instance rules or the golden rule. Not necessarily limited to pictures, but it's super easy to export and that's what we're doing in this game anyway# Rules1) No pictures of pictures. Must be screenshots. Super easy on Switch to [take screenshots](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22343/~/how-to-capture-and-view-screenshots) and export them to your [smartphone by direct wifi](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/53138/~/how-to-transfer-screenshots-and-video-captures-to-a-smart-device-wirelessly) or to your [computer via usb](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/53664/~/how-to-transfer-screenshots-and-video-captures-to-a-computer-via-a-usb-cable). The Chads among us playing on an original N64 will need a video capture decice if using an OG cart or play on a flash cart for easy transfer of save data to PC to screen grab from an emulator.2) OC only, no reposting original in game pictures pictures. Memeing is a different story3) Memes encouraged. Okay to reuse pictures taken in game for this purpose"
