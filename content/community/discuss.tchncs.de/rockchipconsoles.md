name: "rockchipconsoles"
description: "A community for consoles based around the rockchip processors like Anbernic, Powkiddy or Odroid.**Note:** ArkOS has been deprecated for the Anbernic RG351M/P. Please use the Wummel fork or AmberELEC instead. There is no support for the final version on these devices.## Rules* No offtopic.* Keep the posts in English. Our mods can't moderate any language spoken on this planet. If we see a post violating this rule we will immediately delete it.* Do not engage in illegal activities, this also means posting links to ROMs, decryption keys, BIOS files or other illegal content. If you look for ROMs do it yourself at your own risk. Posting your own homebrew games or mods that require the original game to work is fine though.* This community is for everything about Rockchip-based consoles. Integrated consoles (like those running off a cheap NES board) or things like the Steam Deck (which are a lot more powerful) are considered offtopic.* If you need help with your device or want to meet up with other people using Netplay you are allowed to do so.* Do not engage in low-quality posting or posting memes. If you want to post memes go and look out for gaming-related meme communities.* Be kind and respectful when posting. There are humans on the other side of the screen."
