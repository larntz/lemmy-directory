description: "From the charred remains of Reddit's r/PipeTobacco comes a Speakeasy, a place to hang out and talk about pipes and cigars, whisky and beer, and all that.We have pretty basic rules.  1) Don't be an idiot.2) Don't be a dick.Can you manage that?  Then welcome!Our companion web site, which is a full-featured forum, is https://speak-easy.club/ .  We have sections for many alcohol and tobacco related vices.  You have to sign up to see content, but any email address will do (though Yahoo seems to have blacklisted our service provider).  No ads, no tracking, no costs, no bots, ever."
