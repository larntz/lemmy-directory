This can be for artists, designers, coders, or anything inbetween. There's a community [!game_dev_classifieds](/c/game_dev_classifieds@lemmy.ml) on lemmy.ml, but it's still being bogged down really hard so it's hard to reply from other instances.![green crystal](https://misnina.neocities.org/emotes/cry_green_1x.png) Please keep reposts of listings to once a week. If there's not a lot of activity on the community, just reply to your own post to say you're still interested. Please change your tag to *[Filled]* or *[Not Available]* when finished.![green crystal](https://misnina.neocities.org/emotes/cry_green_1x.png)  *[Hiring]* must be paid work, and do not ask *[For Hire]* posters to work for free. The unpaid work tags are *[Offering Help]* and *[Help Wanted]*![green crystal](http://misnina.neocities.org/e/cry_green_1x.png)  There is the [!selfpromotion](/c/selfpromotion@crystals.rest) community for just linking your pitch for upcoming or newly released games unprompted. This doesn't stop you from linking it when you are showing off cool things and progress reports, but try not to have a *'marketed'* approach to how often you update. Show updates of substance.![yellow crystal](http://misnina.neocities.org/e/cry_yellow_1x.png) Direct NSFW content cannot be linked, but you may link to the creator's general channels or socials and tell everyone where to go.![red crystal](http://misnina.neocities.org/e/cry_red_1x.png)  **No NFTS, cryptocurrency, or AI related content**##### **Recommended Tags***[Showcase] [Tutorial] [Resources] [Question]**[For Hire] [Hiring] [Offering Help] [Help Wanted]*"
