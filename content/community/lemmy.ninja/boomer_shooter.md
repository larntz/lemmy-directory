description: "Boomer Shooters are a sub-genre of first-person shooter (FPS) games, known for harking back to the fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled action of 1990s classics like DOOM, Quake, and Duke Nukem. They emphasize run-and-gun gameplay, maze-like level design, and an arsenal of diverse weapons. With little regard for realism, these games prioritize explosive action, non-linear exploration, and often feature fantastical, over-the-top enemies and environments.- **Be respectful**: Treat other users with respect and kindness.
