title: "Top 5" 
name: "top5"
description: "A community to share your top 5 of anything. Examples:- Top 5 movies about alien encounters- Top 5 Gameboy Color games- Top 5 crustaceans- Top 5 David Bowie songsWhy five and not ten or twenty? I don't know, five seems easy enough to make a list about anything, and short enough to not be just a long list of whatever.Rules1. The list must be subjective (best, worst, etc) not objective (size, sells, etc).2. List must be ranked (no in no particular order stuff).2. Only text posts (no links, no images).3. Posts must include a list (no requests).4. Title must start with Top 5...5. Keep it SFW"
