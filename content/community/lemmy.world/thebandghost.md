description: "A community for discussing all things Ghost. Ghost is a Swedish rock band from Sweden, formed in 2006. They are currently touring the world in the Re-Imperatour cycle. Basic Rules- So, everyone‚Äôs here to have a good time, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the ways we keep it a good time- If you are feeling like your brain is a little wobbly at the new format: https://lemmy.world/post/67020 may help figure things out. This is an ALL AGES group- please keep the sexy talk to a minimum and stick to about a PG13 level here. I am certain that there are other places for the after-dark discussions, I probably belong to a couple of them. This, however, is a family group and not a group for makin‚Äô families. Heeeeeyooooo. This is a Ghost discussion community: of course, as with any artform- there are topics that the music might bring up. I feel that type of discourse is incredibly important but, thus far, I haven‚Äôt seen much to indicate people realize how to discuss heated issues. Perhaps we can change that, perhaps we cannot- but for now: we will not ban those types of discussions but, you will need to refrain from personal attacks. Racism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, ageism, and pretty much any of that? Not tolerated. Don‚Äôt do it. If you don‚Äôt like those types of discussions, nobody is making you click the link and have it. Just scroll on. If you feel you need to step back, have a juice box and a cookie before you continue, do that. Just don‚Äôt be a jerk. Additionally, the moderator is big, big big time into the lore and exploring the symbolism. If you aren‚Äôt, listen, it‚Äôs cool. I definitely get it, but again, just scroll on by. We don‚Äôt really care if you have some opinion about ‚Äúmetal or not‚Äù. Honestly. Well informed discussion about why you enjoyed or did not enjoy particular things is always welcome- not everyone‚Äôs going to enjoy the same things. That seems like one of those things we shouldn‚Äôt have to say: but apparently, it is.Fan art and covers are absolutely welcome here: but credit your artists. Link to their stuff, hype them up. Art has never, ever been more important and we should be supporting our artists, fully. <3 End of the day, just don‚Äôt be a damn vibe killer. Toodles, kids. Credits: Icon- Zbigniew M. BielakBanner- Jimmy Hubbard"
