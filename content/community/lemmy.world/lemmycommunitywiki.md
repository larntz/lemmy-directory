description: "The community for the lemmy community wiki!**Not affiliated with lemmy creators**---Wiki site:community.lemmywiki.com---**If you have any issues please make a post here or dm me directly!**---This is currently only run by 1 person because of this:  - **please be patient with load times**, as I do not have high availability set up yet, but I will be upgrading in the future.   - signup to use is currently only invite only, **and limited to moderators.**   - If you'd like to make a wiki for your sub, **please dm me here, I will probably accept your application if you moderate a community.** - **you don't need an account to read the wiki**  - **It's free for you! But it's not free for me**, and could get very expensive over time! **Donations would be greatly appreciated so I can scale up and keep this running!**         - **[You can donate here!](https://cash.app/$lemmywiki)**"
