description: "This subreddit was created due to a flood of patient questions in various other eye-related communities. However, given that medical advice over the internet cannot be given without an exam, and that legal liability is tremendously high for telling someone eh, it's probably nothing, don't worry, please understand that it is likely that many of your less pressing questions may not receive satisfactory answers. # Rules- 1: online advice can never replace an actual in person medical examination.- 2: no spamming or multiple posts about the same topic, this includes posts across other communities.- 3: anxiety driven posts are not welcome.- 4: posts must contain enough details. At the very least you should include your  - main complaint including:     - onset of complaints    - duration of complaints     - affected eye(s)    - any treatment you've tried so far  - age  - gender (biological)  - prior ophthalmic conditions  - medication and/or drug usage  - systemic conditions if present- 5: no questions about aftercare after surgery.- 6: don't remove old posts and/or create new accounts.- 7: don't post personal data of your doctor.- 8: don't give advice on subjects you're not familiar with. Advice that's considered bad or even harmful will be removed."
