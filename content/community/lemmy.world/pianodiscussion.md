description: "We need an active piano discussion forum! With a lot of discussion boards on the internet dying out, there is a lot of potential to have a decentralized platform for discussing piano.I would welcome any advice, questions, and so on over here. Hopefully, we can curate some excellent information and guidance for everyone. I'll make sure to reply to every post on here. So let's get some discussion flowing!"
