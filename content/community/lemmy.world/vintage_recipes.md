description: "A community for sharing favorite vintage and nostalgic recipes from years past. The goal of this community is to preserve our favorite dishes and share them with the world so that they don't go extinct just because they're not in the culinary zeitgeist.Please tag your recipe titles with **[RECIPE]**. Be sure to include the dish name and it’s creator (person or business) in the title for easier searching. Please include the date the recipe was published, if possible.Sharing a video? Tag it with **[VIDEO]**.All requests should be tagged with **[REQUEST]**. Before you post, make sure someone hasn’t already requested the same recipe!**No recipe blog spam! You can link to a personal blog in the comments, but please include the recipe itself in your post. Any post URLs should point to the actual recipe (website, image host, etc.) and not just serve as an advertisement to drive up clicks for your site.**We here in Vintage Recipes believe that information should be freely available. We learn by observing and analyzing what has come before. We do not believe in secrets, and we do not believe that old methods should be forgotten."
