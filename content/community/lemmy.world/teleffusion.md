title: "A mix of the game Telephone and Stable Diffusion" 
name: "teleffusion"
description: "An experiment in community gaming.Easy rules:1) When creating a post, include an image and it's dimensions.2) Commenters copy the picture, run their favorite stable diffusion settings on it, and post the results(The telephone part comes from comments on comments, so running your stable diffusion settings against someone else's already posted results.)The tooling I use for Stable Diffusion is running ComfyUI locally with models downloaded from HuggingFace and Civitai.com. If you can’t run it locally I recommend the Stable Horde communities Stable-UI: https://aqualxx.github.io/stable-ui/ It’s community driven by people’s spare computing power and relatively easy to use interface."
