description: "Dunking on Tankies from a leftist perspective.A tankie is someone who defends/supports authoritarian or even totalitarian regimes who call themselves socialist. The term originated from people supporting the 1956 invasion of Hungary by the Soviet Union. Nowadays they are just terminally online, denying genocides, and falling for totalitarian propaganda and calling such regimes true democracies."
