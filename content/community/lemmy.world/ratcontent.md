description: "This is mostly for crossposting from https://mstdn.party/@ratcontent, but I am happy if other people post too!Focus is on rats or mice in movies and TV shows. Videogames are ok if there's a cutscene that can be clipped.This isn't for posting pet rats, there's other better places for that."
