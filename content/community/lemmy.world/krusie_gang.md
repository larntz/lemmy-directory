description: "**Welcome to The Krusie Gang Clubhouse (Lemmy Edition)!**This community is dedicated to shipping of Kris and Susie (Hence the ship name Krusie) from the upcoming video game by Toby Fox: Deltarune!Post everything related to Krusie here! And enjoy your stay!---**RULES:****1: Shippy stuff must be Krusie, non shippy stuff must include either Kris or Susie.**This sub is oriented at pairing Kris/Susie and as such, posts must be related to it. However, posting *non shippy* stuff is also accepted if they include Kris or Susie solo!**2: Be civil.**Nobody likes meanies, especially in a place that's made for good fun and enjoyment.Instance-wide Lemmy rules apply here too.**3: Keep it SFW.**You're allowed to post really really mild NSFW stuff (innuendos, blood and such), but mark it as NSFW. Act SFW too, we don't want to see anything naughty or raunchy.**4: Source the material you provide!***Barring the original content posted here*, all posts with content **must** provide both:- Artist/Writer's name in the title- The source link in a top-level comment (or in the post itself)**5: No ship-hating, trolling, forcing headcanons onto others or dramaposting/slandering people or the sub.**A ship is personal preference, putting one ship above another is non-sense! We're in this together, don't make it out like something is better than the other. Trolling and attempts to bait are also not allowed. Forcing headcanons onto others (like character gender and trying to force someone to think what you think) is highly disallowed, and will be sanctioned accordingly. Posting about drama and people who dislike the ship and giving them attention is not allowed either - we are a shipping sub, not a drama hub. Slandering this subreddit to try and troll or cause drama, or slandering others here, is highly disallowed.**6: Be careful about reposts.**You cannot post the same work again until **6 months** has passed since its previous posting.**The only time when we allow a repost is if it is the creator of the work who's posting it here and their work was posted by someone else before!****7: Have fun!**The most important rule of all!"
