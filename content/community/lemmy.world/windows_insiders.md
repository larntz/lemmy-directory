description: "A place to talk about the Windows Insiders program, new releases, bugs, etc.. It isn't for general Windows troubleshooting, but for Insider releases. Official Site: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsinsider/Channels:Canary - Preview the latest and greatest early in the development cycle. Possibly unstable, some things may not work yet. For highly technical users.Dev - Rough edges and low stability. For enthusiasts. Beta - More reliable, updates are validated by Microsoft. For early adopters. Release Preview - Most stable, one step below commercial release. Good for commercial and home users wanting to try it before it's released. "
