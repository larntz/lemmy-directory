description: "**A community dedicated to helping people identify birds**The rules for posting and commenting, besides the rules defined here for lemmy.world, are as follows:**Rules:**1. Bird identification only. No memes, jokes, or awesome bird photos (that you know the species of). There are other communities out there for that. Please mark posts about the community with META2. Any sign of birds are allowed, this includes but is not limited to: photos, blurry photos, feathers, eggs, audio, Ms Paint drawings, verbal descriptions, etc. 3. Mark dead or seriously injured birds as NSFW4.  Please try to provide any information you possibly have. Rough Location, terrain, time of year, and time of day can all be helpful. But please don't dox yourself, within 30 miles is usually just fine, no need for gps coordinates."
