Upload your picture directly, or link the direct image URL if using an image hosting site.3. **No easy to find locations:** Try to present a challenge to your fellow Scavengers. A picture of Hyrule Castle taken from Hyrule Fields, for example, is too easy.4. **Mark your spoilers:** Any posts that have major storyline spoilers (e.g., Major bosses or DLC content) must be marked as a spoiler.5. **How to submit a guess:** When you find the location you think the picture was taken at, take a screenshot using the screenshot button.
