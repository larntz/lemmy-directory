description: "**About**Florida Governor Ron DeSantis aspires to be the same kind of Autocrat despised by the founders of the United States. He must be exposed for what he is: a great threat to our Democratic Republic and American values. Republicans don't punish big businesses like the Walt Disney Company for disagreeing with them. Fascists do. DeSantis and those like him are a massive threat to our Democracy.**Rules**1. Nazis and Putin sympathizers are not welcome here.2. The tolerant, open-minded and freedom-loving ARE welcome here. Glad to have you good people : )3. Attack the media and expect to be banned. There is a good reason why the press is included in the First Amendment. If you cannot respect the vital role that an independent media plays in terms of checks and balances, this isn't the right group for you.4. Be respectful of our differences, whether it's race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.5. No Spam, Threats, Harassment or Doxing of any kind.6. No trolling, disinformation, or low effort posts / comments.![](https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/4b8b364e-f5c8-427c-8675-c1beb1724a61.jpeg)**Social Media**[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Bts7hsQXeE)[Squabble](https://squabbles.io/s/DeSantisThreatensUSA)[SubReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeSantisThreatensUSA/)"
