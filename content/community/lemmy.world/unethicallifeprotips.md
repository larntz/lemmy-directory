The title should explain the gist of the ULPT without needing a description. Post that are walls of text will be deleted at the mods discretion.- No tips about rape, murder, suicide, or any tips that violate Geneva Convention laws.- No tip lists, each individual post should be about a single tip. This includes links to articles that list tips. "
