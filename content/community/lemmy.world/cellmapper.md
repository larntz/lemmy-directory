description: "We're the unofficial Lemmy community for all things Cellmapper, an app to record and display mobile network information & quality. This Lemmy community is based on the r/Cellmapper subreddit.In addition to content related to the Cellmapper app, the r/Cellmapper subreddit is also frequently used for general cell tower equipment identification, which will also be allowed in this community.Any moderator of r/Cellmapper that would like moderator access here feel free to send me a message.Rules (currently copied from the Cellmapper subreddit):1. Don't be rude or disruptiveWe're happy to give people some slack but we want to maintain the community as an inclusive and supportive one that's open to people of all levels of knowledge about mobile networks.Examples of rude / disruptive behaviour include but aren't limited to: Excessive Swearing / Directed Swearing at an individual as an insult, showing huge levels of disdain to someone with less knowledge than yourself, hounding users about irrelevant points, just generally being a bit of a knob.2. Don't reveal the location of other usersFairly simply rule I think, considering the nature of Cellmapper we store a lot of information that is geotagged. If you have knowledge about someone that isn't public, don't be a knob and reveal it to the world unless they want to. It's just basic manners to be honest.3. Please try and keep complaints constructiveWe get it. Cellmapper sometimes doesn't work as well as it should or sometimes is just a bit frustrating. We know! We use it ourselves and find it just as annoying. We're a small group of people and it's all done on a voluntary basis when we have free time, we're not commercial like some of the other sites but we do try. If you've got feedback, constructive criticism or anything like this get in touch with us, we'd love to hear it and we love speaking to users, but please don't be too rude!"
