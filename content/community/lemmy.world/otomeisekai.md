title: "Otome Isekai+" 
name: "otomeisekai"
description: "**OVERVIEW**A community for Otome Isekai series, the female-oriented genre where the main character is transported to an otome-game like world. Kept the name so people looking for an alternative to r/OtomeIsekai could easily find it, but added the Plus to reflect that the genre has evolved to include adjacent series. I'm happy to hand over control if someone else wants to take over. *****GUIDELINES**- DO NOT post links to unofficial translations, especially in the post title. It can cause issues for translators and force them to stop. (Also please support the author if available in your country.)- Related items are more than welcome. I love botched translations and scribbles artists try to pass off as horses and would love to continue seeing these types of posts. However, posts should have a connection to Otome Isekai content. - If you post a photo, please include the source - Spoilers are not allowed in post titles. They are allowed in comments, but must be hidden.Open to feedback on this section. If this ends up taking off then maybe the definition of OI and discussion will need to be stricter. Until then, I don't think there's a need to feel restricted by technicalities.*****EXAMPLES**- Classic OI Example: *Lady Rose Wants to Be a Commoner* Female main character isekais into an otome game as a villainess- OI Twist Example: *An Observation Log of My Fianc√©e Who Calls Herself a Villainess*Male main character's commentary on the female lead who isekai'ed as the villainess Added this to point out that the main character (MC) does not necessarily need to be a woman, but if the MC is not a woman, it'll generally need more OI setting pieces to qualify as an OI.- Modern OI Example: *Who Made Me a Princess?* Female main character isekais into the world of a (non-otome game) fantasy book she read- Otome Isekai Adjacent Example: *Your Throne* None of the characters are isekai'ed but the setting is otome-esque and one of the female main characters is a villainess*****Icon**: *The One Within the Villainess* because Remilia is unrivaled**Banner**: *My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!* because it's a literal otome isekai"
