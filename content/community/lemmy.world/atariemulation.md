description: "This channel is exclusively about emulators for the Atari consoles and computers. Since there is a very limited amount of hardware available, many people can't enjoy their earlier Atari days and have to use emulators. While there are subreddits for each Atari console and computer system, the Atari emulator community is being lost in the hardware discussions taking place. The same can be said about other emulator subreddits that have many Nintendo and other system followers.But you can also post information about Atari software and the like. Anything to help our fellow Atarians get the most out of their systems.Rules:1. No Direct Links to Ads, Sales, etc.No links for just commercial purposes.2. Self Promotion OKSelf Promotion can link to a web site that contains information or tutorials about Atari emulation. If cannot be a direct sales only link. (See rule#1).3. No Politics, Social Comments. Just Atari Stuff."
