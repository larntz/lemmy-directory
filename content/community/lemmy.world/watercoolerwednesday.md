description: "What are Rules?#1-Don't be a dick. This includes (but is not limited to) racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia and other bigotry, as well as directed attacks and deliberately stirring up shit either by trolling or in reference to previous drama.#2-Pasta is sacred. We are always welcoming of pasta, memes and general fuckery. It's why we're here, after all. Show hog and you'd better pray you're 6'2 jacked and fucking packing.#3-We are our own thing. Other subs are other subs. Please don't link to this sub elsewhere. Feel free to invite your friends privately, but don't post this thread anywhere else or go to other subs and start shit. Likewise, please don’t rabble rouse here regarding issues on other subs. Anything that could be construed as brigading, for example.#4-Bantha Enthusiasm is allowed until Cube sees this, Bantha's can survive anywhere easily.#5-If you see something, say something. We are shitposters first and mods second. We want this place to be great for everyone. If you see someone being abused, or you are yourself, please report it and/or drop us a modmail message (with screenshots if you have them).#6-Please don’t post porn here. Anything NSFW should be clearly marked. GIFs in comments are automatically loaded, so no NSFW GIFs are allowed since they cannot be avoided. As for the definition of porn? We’ll know it when we see it.FlairsFlair text is changeable by editing the degenerate text flairNote:We're all here for the same reason. Public opinion rules, so please reach out with any questions or suggestions. Also, a hotdog is a sandwich."
