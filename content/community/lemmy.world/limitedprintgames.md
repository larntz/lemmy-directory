description: "A community for enthusiasts and collectors of physical video games, specifically dedicated to limited print games and the companies that produce them.In addition to discussion, this community is also intended for announcements of upcoming releases. The announcements aim to be helpful, as there are several limited print companies to keep track of, and new releases are often only available for a short window.If you're aware of an upcoming limited print game that hasn't been posted here yet, feel free to add it!This will likely never grow beyond being a small, niche community, but please follow just a few simple rules:1. Be civil. Limited print game companies haven't always been the best at communicating, delivering on promises, and shipping in a timely fashion. So any community dedicated to them is sure to have some frustrated members. It's ok to express that frustration when appropriate, but please be civil about it.2. Be kind. Disagreements are normal and it's ok to debate. But please be respectful to each other.3. Limited print only. It's not a problem at all for discussion to veer into the world of wide-release games. However please limit new posts to topics regarding limited print games/companies only.4. No piracy. Purchasing limited print games supports developers and publishers, many of whom are very small. Absolutely NO discussion of, or links to, anything piracy-related is permitted.Thank you, and I hope you enjoy your time here!"
