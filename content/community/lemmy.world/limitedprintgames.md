description: "A community for enthusiasts and collectors of physical video games, dedicated to announcements and discussion of limited print games and the companies that produce them.This will likely never grow beyond being a small, niche community, but please follow just a few simple rules:1. Be civil. Limited print game companies haven't always been the best at communicating, delivering on promises, and shipping in a timely fashion. So any community dedicated to them is sure to have some frustrated members. It's ok to express that frustration when appropriate, but please be civil about it and remember that venting isn't the purpose of this community.2. Be kind. Disagreements are normal and it's ok to debate. But please be respectful to each other.3. Limited print only. It's not a problem for discussion to veer into the world of wide-release games, but please limit all new posts to topics regarding limited print games/companies only.4. No piracy. Purchasing limited print games supports developers and publishers, many of whom are very small. Absolutely NO discussion of, or links to, anything piracy-related is permitted."
