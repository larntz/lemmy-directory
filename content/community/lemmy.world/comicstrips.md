description: "**Comic Strips** is a community for those who love comics (short stories). The rules are simple:- You may post comics from others or your own.- The post can be a single image, a image gallery, or a link to a specific comic hosted on another site (the author's website, for instance).- If it is a link, it must be to a specific story, not to the root of the site.- The comic must be a complete story.- If you are posting a comic of your own, a maximum of one per week (I know, your comics are great, but this rule helps avoid spam).- Politeness comes first.- The comic can be in any language, but if it's not in English, OP must include a translation into English as a comment.- Adult content is not allowed. This community aims to be fun for people of all ages."
