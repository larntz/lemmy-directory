description: ">The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a **hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization.** According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I. J. Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a runaway reaction of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an explosion in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence. *— Wikipedia*This is a community for discussing theoretical and practical consequences related to the singularity, or any other innovation in the realm of machine learning capable of potentially disrupting our society.You can share news, research papers, discussions and opinions. This community is mainly meant for information and discussion, so entertainment (such as memes) should generally be avoided, unless the content is thought-provoking or has some other qualities.**Rules:**- Be nice to everyone, even if you disagree.- No spam.
