description: "Cutwords (aka Cu2rds) - when words are cut (or smooshed together) in unintended places, creating a completely different meaning.**Rules**1. Posts must feature a wrong syntaxic interpretation (for example, a word being read as two words or vice-versa) leading to an unintended meaning. (Except meta posts - see rule 4.)2. Language - any language is allowed for now, but please indicate it with the language setting on post creation.3. Reposts - duplicates of posts already posted in Cu2rds will be removed. Reposts from other communities are allowed and welcomed.4. Meta posts - if your post is about the Cu2rds community itself (e.g. suggestions for rule changes) please start your title with a [META] tag. 5. The usual - no illegal stuff, be nice to each other and respect the lemmy.world and Lemmy rules.---These rules are intentionally very laxist for now to allow more content there - we'll see if we need more strict rules if the community grows."
