description: "It's like a specialized /r/Rabbits .Bunnies with hats only. Hats can be unconventional -- even other bunnies.Rules:1. All images should include a bunny with a hat.We mean hat in the loosest sense of the object. Acceptable hats include vegetables, wigs, and toys, among others.2. No vote solicitation.e.g. /c/aww didn't like my bunny, Can I get some love.., etc.Your rabbit will gain karma based on their merit by being a bunny.3. Post sources of non-original content.Clearly indicate in the title if a post is a cross-post. Leave a comment with credit or best guess at a source if a post is not personal original content. Posts that do not follow these rules may be removed without warning.4. No obvious or regular defensive willful negligence of pet rabbits.Any obvious posts of neglectful pet rabbit welfare (including but not limited to small cages, wire flooring, untreated medical issues, etc.) will be removed. If there is regular evidence of poor pet rabbit care after receiving repeated feedback from the community, a user may have their posts removed and be banned based on moderator discretion.5. No image posts about bathing rabbits or handling rabbits on their backs.Bathing and trancing can cause unnecessary stress to rabbits and are not recommended unless medically necessary due to the dangers of the hold. Ambiguous photos of rabbits placed on their backs may also be removed even if the rabbit is not fully tranced. Originally [r/BunniesWithHats](https://old.reddit.com/r/bunnieswithhats/)"
