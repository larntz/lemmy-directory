description: "# MensLib: For the development and well-being of menWelcome! MensLib is a community to explore and address men's issues in a positive and solutions-focused way. Through discussing the male gender role, providing mutual support, raising awareness on men's issues, and promoting efforts that address them, we hope to create active progress on issues men face, and to build a healthier, kinder, and more inclusive masculinity. We recognize that men's issues often intersect with race, sexual orientation and identity, disability, socioeconomic status, and other axes of identity, and encourage open discussion of these considerations. We consider ourselves a pro-feminist community.#### A note: This community is _not_ moderated by the team from the [subreddit of the same name](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/). The primary goal of this forum on Lemmy.world is to create a beachhead here in the event that Reddit fully implodes in short order. The posts and moderation style here do not necessarily reflect that of the Men's Lib subreddit.# Our MissionThe MensLib mission is threefold.* To examine and address issues men face, individually and in society, through discussion, information-sharing, recruitment, and advocacy.* To model a healthy and effective men's issues movement, grounded in academic intersectional gender studies, that focuses on solutions, positivity, inclusivity, and mutual support.* To explore and revisit traditional models of masculinity, in order to promote the development of men as better and healthier individuals, participants in their relationships, and leaders in their communities.# Rules### MensLib is a space for constructive discussion of men's issues. Moderators reserve complete discretion to maintain a productive conversation, including removing comments and submissions, and banning offenders.### General Rules* Be civil.* Be the men's issues conversation you want to see in the world.* Attack ideas, not individuals* Slurs and hatespeech are prohibited* Negative stereotyping and insensitivity towards protected groups will not be tolerated.* Do not call other users' personal stories into question.* Complaints about moderation must be served through modmail, not in the comments.* Links to elsewhere on the Fediverse must promote constructive discussions of men's issues.* This is a pro-feminist community and unconstructive anti-feminism is not allowed.### Posting Rules* When making a link post, please post a top-level comment that promotes discussion.* Image links must be submitted within self posts, which should include a discussion prompt about how it relates to men's issues.* Do not editorialize headlines.* No outrage porn-type articles.* Self promoting, fundraising and audio or video posts should be submitted through the moderators for approval."
