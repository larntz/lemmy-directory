description: "Discussion of the 8-bit video game console NES and its software/hardware/peripherals.Rules:- Discussions must be related to the NES or its games. Import/Famicom discussion is also acceptable.- No low effort posts. This includes collection pics and things you found in the wild. FYI eBay is not the wild.- No What's my game/console/item worth? posts. You can find this stuff out in 5 seconds on Google and we're not paid to be your appraisers.- No discussions related to grading. At all.- Modern homebrew and hardware/software development discussion is welcome."
