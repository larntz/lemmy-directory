description: "Welcome to ADHD Talk!ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. This community is designed to provide a platform for individuals with ADHD to engage in informative and supportive conversations. While we appreciate the value of humor, our focus is on fostering meaningful discussions and sharing valuable information.**Rules &amp; Guidelines:****1. Be Respectful:** Treat fellow community members with kindness and respect. We encourage open-mindedness and understanding while engaging in discussions. **2. Serious Discussions:** This is not the place for memes and low-quality jokes. This community is intended for serious discussions related to ADHD. While occasional light-heartedness is welcome, we prioritize substantive conversations over memes and similar content. For a more lighthearted experience, we recommend visiting !ADHD.**3. Seeking Professional Help:** While we do not exclude individuals who have self-diagnosed, we strongly encourage seeking professional help and obtaining an official diagnosis. Professional guidance can provide valuable insights, support, and appropriate treatment options.**4. Politics-Free Zone:** This community is inclusive and politically neutral. We aim to maintain a space that transcends political differences and focuses solely on ADHD-related topics. Political discussions are tolerated but not encouraged, and preaching radical political views has no place here.**5. ADHD as a Genuine Disorder:** Denying that ADHD is a disorder is prohibited. ADHD is not a funny quirk or a mere personality trait; it is a genuine neurodevelopmental disorder. While some people with ADHD may be high-functioning and not experience certain challenges, it must be acknowledged that ADHD can significantly impact the lives of many individuals and has a profound negative effect on their quality of life. We encourage empathy and understanding for those who face these challenges.**6. Citing Sources:** When discussing medical information or research, we strongly encourage citing reliable sources. This promotes accuracy, credibility, and informed discussions within the community.**7. Personal Experiences and Self-Medication:** It is acceptable to share personal experiences with self-medication methods related to ADHD. However, promoting self-medication, particularly with controlled substances, is strictly prohibited. We prioritize safety and encourage seeking professional guidance for any treatment-related concerns.**8. ADHD and LGBTQ+:** ADHD Talk is a welcoming community for queer and transgender individuals. We promote inclusivity and vehemently oppose homophobia or transphobia. However, ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Sexual orientation or gender identity are not. While we encourage discussions about the intersection between having ADHD and being LGBTQ+, it is important to remember that these are two distinct aspects of a person's identity. Having ADHD does not automatically grant someone a place in queer conversations."
