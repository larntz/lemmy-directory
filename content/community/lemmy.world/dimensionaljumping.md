description: "### INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Kbin Dimensional Jumping magazine. This place exists to provide a new avenue for Reddit migrators to discuss the phenomena of dimensional shifts, leaps, jumps, etc. Copied from the original subreddit, [t]his is a place to share your personal experiences of the shifting nature of reality, through the deliberate application of techniques to bring about 'jumps' in our personal worlds - in effect, switching to a more desirable universe.Universe # 982Please note that a shift in your experience does not require a change in [this] number, which should be treated as an emblem of change and a symbol of potential rather than an ID.### OVERVIEWThe essence of Dimensional Jumping is the leveraging of perspective-structuring metaphors and the techniques derived from them. Links to the original methods are archived on the original subreddit and will be duplicated here as some of the introductory posts. Among them are the Mirror Method, Active Metaphors (Hall of Records, Infinite Grid, etc), and the Owls of Eternity and Two Glass experiments.### RULESThe rules are pretty straightforward.1. Be good to each other. This should go without saying but please post quality content, treat other users with respect, and above all else just be kind. Try to be open to others experiences and don't limit your perspective by engaging in bad conduct. It's possible that the other user may not understand the material at first--every new interaction is a learning opportunity.2. This is not the community for fictional horror stories/tales. Please only post genuine experiences, experiments, trials, questions, etc.3. As a result of Rule #2, please assume that the stories you read here are truth and not falsehood.4. Don't spam.### NOTEThe following has been extracted verbatim from the original sidebar of /r/DimensionalJumping:There is no established theory of 'jumping' or its mechanism, although there are numerous ways of viewing its nature.It is for readers to decide for themselves through personal investigation and introspection whether jumping is appropriate for them or not.An open mind combined with healthy caution is the correct mindset for all approaches targeted at the subjective experience.Never believe something without personal evidence; never dismiss something without personal evidence.What is the number?Part of the original mythology is: maybe you can keep track of changes in your reality by referring to an anchor number or Universe ID for your dimension..."
