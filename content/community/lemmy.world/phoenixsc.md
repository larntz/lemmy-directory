Adhere to the rules & TOS of Lemmy.world9. Avoid posting things that Phoenix has already made10. Avoid Overdone & Unoriginal Concepts  INFO:* For point 7: if content from Reddit gets reposted here it is okay as long as it is not spam* If you already are a PhoenixSC moderator on Reddit or similar you can simply prove per screenshot that you are one and i add you as a moderator as fast as i notice it* if you are a normal person and want to be a moderator i try to check you out and then i decide. You may see it as a god complex and it certainly IS. But i want to be a nice god"
