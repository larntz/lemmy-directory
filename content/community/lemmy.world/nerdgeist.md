description: "c/nerdgeist is a community space dedicated to sharing and discussing anything in the current nerd zeitgeist. This could be movie casting news, new video game discussions, whacky theories about your favorite franchises, or just about anything that the modern nerdy person would enjoy or want to talk about. My hope for this channel is that it becomes a hub for people to talk about the things that maybe are a harder to talk about IRL because folks may not have the same interests as you. It's a great feeling when you're pumped about something and you find someone else who is too! Lets make this a space where those feelings happen much more often. **Rules**1. Be respectful - this is meant to be a positive space.2. Don't spam content or try to advertise your products or channels.3. If something is NSFW, mark as such. 4. Know the channel will evolve with it's userbase and new rules may be added over time or current ones may be updated updated to help create the best community experience as possible. "
