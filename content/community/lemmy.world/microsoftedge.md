description: "A Fediverse community dedicated to Microsoft Edge. Not ran by Microsoft. -----# Rules1. No spam (promoting products outside of Microsoft's own releases). This includes link shorteners of any kind that track users clicks. Use [**MagLit**](https://maglit.me) instead. Using a service to redirect to circumvent any rules **will** result in an instant suspension from this community. 2. No promotion of extensions require any payment; (Tab Reminder, Caret Tab) these will be considered as **sponsored** posts. 3. While posting news and articles is okay, **NO** links or redirects to your social media (Twitter, Reddit, etc.). If you are going to post something, post it on a Fediverse instance. There is no need for blog spam. 4. No **clickbait titles** (includes news articles) (e.g., *Microsoft Edge will get a feature users have been waiting for* instead of *Microsoft Edge will now block trackers from seeing your IP address to stop tracking*). 5. No **NSFW Content**. If you have an issue that is resulting in adult images, blur or cover the image up. 6. No YouTube or video links that discuss or otherwise mention Microsoft Edge unless from Microsoft themselves. These videos are clickbait, and provide little to no value. (e.g, **Five Best Browsers for Windows!**) These types of videos are designed to garner views and generate ad revenue, and rarely offer comprehensive and authentic commentary. -----Following these rules will help keep this community clean, organic and contribute information on the #Fediverse.
