description: "Have you ever wanted to buy a game on Steam but didn’t know if it was good? Have you ever had just enough money for an indie game but didn’t know whether it was worth buying? Have you ever asked yourself, “Should I buy this game?”-------------------------------**POST FORMAT**SIB name of game [specific info]?WSIB [specific info]?YSB/YSNB name of gameSIB = Should I BuyWSIB = What Should I BuyYSB/YSNB = You Should Buy/You Should Not BuyTitles should be short and concise. In the description of your post, describe why, how, and what you are confused about. Users should not have to ask you clarification questions. All threads with no added information will be removed on sight.-------------------------------- When asking for a recommendation, help us by providing context to your question. Give us details about what types of games you enjoy, which games you don't enjoy, and why you're unsure about your purchase. People can't help you make a decision if you don't express yourself. For this reason, we require all posts to be at least 300 characters long.- You may not make threads on unreleased content. People can't give you a recommendation on something that no one had the chance to try out.- Check to make sure that the topic on your thread hasn't been made with the search bar. Recent reposts are bad. If there's already a thread on the front page about the game you're asking about, your thread will probably get removed.- No spoilers without a warning. Spoilers include, and are not limited to, revealing something about the plot late in the game or explaining an important plot point. This goes for both comments and posts. Mark something as a spoiler by putting the spoiler text in between >! and !< (with no space in between). It should appear as like this: Broodje eats socks!. You can get banned on the first offense for this."
