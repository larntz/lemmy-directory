description: "Community guidelines: 1. Must be anime/manga fluff.     Posted content should be 2D fluffy tails, of the manga/anime variety. 2. No AI generated content.     Due to the potential for abuse, AI generated work is not permitted and will be removed. 3. Must only be Human/kemonomimi.      Animals with the fluff are fine as long as a human/kemonomimi with a tail is also present.  4. Anthropomorphic content not permitted.     Anthropomorphic characters are off topic and will be removed. 5. NSFW tagging is required.     Suggestive/implied nudity/lewdness is OK and does not require tagging NSFW, but for blatant nudity, or obvious sexual content, tagging NSFW is encouraged.  6. Post source.     Posting the source is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory especially is the source is difficult to find. Habitually not posting source/attribution to the artists is not acceptable however"
