description: "#A Community for All Types of Competitive Wrestling##Rules1) All posts must start with a style tag when relevant:  [FRE] = Freestyle  [FOL] = Folkstyle  [GRE] = Greco-Roman  [JUD] = Judo  [MON] = Mongolian  [SUM] = Sumo  2) New tags will be added upon request. To qualify as a wrestling sport it must be a competitive, contact combat sport, where a participant cannot win by attempting to injure their opponent. We reserve the right to arbitrarily exclude a sport from this sub, even if it technically meets the proposed criteria.  3) No name-calling or other bad behavior.  4) Probably other stuff, but this seems good enough for now."
