Print options are sold at near cost and are very very inexpensive.*[**Old School Essentials Basic**](https://necroticgnome.com/products/old-school-essentials-basic-rules)*OSE is the most popular reproduction of the original B/X set. Uses descending armor class. With several different iterations at several different prices, this PDF is free and covers the basics. Enough to get a game going.*[**White Box : Fantastic Medieval Adventure Game**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/190631/White-Box--Fantastic-Medieval-Adventure-Game)*A spiritual successor to Swords &amp; Sorcery White Box.
