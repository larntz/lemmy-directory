name: "selltrade"
description: "2. Title \ta. See Title Requirements section below.3. Timestamps \ta. This is a picture of your item(s) that has a piece of paper with your HAND WRITTEN username and date (mm/dd/yyyy). Uses of word processing software/digital handwritting on PCs, phones, tablets, etc. are not valid. We recommend using the Imgur image service.\tb. Must be no older than 7 days old at the time of posting.\tc. When taking timestamps make sure to timestamp any damage or defects of the items.\td. You must have the item in hand at the time of posting. Pre-orders, confirmation of orders, etc. are NOT allowed.\te. Timestamps must be of the item itself, and not just a picture of the box. If the item is new and sealed with either plastic wrap, or seal stickers you MUST take a timestamp of both ends of seal in one timestamp per seal. If your item is used or does not have seals/shrink wrap (most common with motherboards or items from Gigabyte), then you must open the box to show the item itself.\tf. All items mentioned in a post must be timestamped. This includes the internal components of a complete PC, a CPU timestamp if applicable, and any items for offered for trade.\tg. If you are selling more than one of a listed item, they must all be visible in the timestamp.\th. Timestamps must be easily legible, as in no cursive or unusual handwriting methods.\ti. We highly recommend you take timestamps of sensitive items and their condition closely. Such as pins on motherboard sockets, or on processors themselves.\tj. You must take a CPU-Z, System Info, or Speccy Timestamp (not a screenshot) for all CPUs installed into a system, this does include laptops/MacBooks. This is to ensure you have the processor listed, and to avoid confusion on laptop specifications.\tk. For cell phones, tablets, and other smart devices (new and old), you must take an About Device or System Info timestamp (not a screenshot) that captures model number, storage size, and/or RAM size. If you do not have another camera available to accomplish the timestamp, you are NOT authorized to list the phone on the community. We recommend censoring IMEI and personalized device name before submitting timestamps!\tl. Additional info on the wiki, including how to post pictures and proper CPU timestamp info.4. Asking Price \ta. Asking prices must be stated for all threads where you are SELLING an item directly for any monetary payment method. This does not apply to threads were you are only trading an item.\tb. You must have a set, realistic asking price for each and every item posted.\tc. No bidding, no auctions.\td. When a sale or trade is completed, it is required that you replace the asking price with the price the item sold for, and to who you sold it to. This helps leave a reference for what items are trending for, and to prevent sellers from double selling. Such as [$200 Sold for $185 to /u/username]5. Posting Limits \ta. You must wait 24 hours between all posts. You can create a new post for a new, unique item once 24 hours passes from your previous post.\tb. You must wait 72 hours (3 Days) between reposting or bumping any Sale, Buying, or Trade threads. You must wait 72 hours to repost any item within your post, even if you remove or add different items.\tc. Adjustments to price, quantity, condition, or any other change must be made in the body. Any information that will change such as quantity available or price should not be placed in the title.\td. Deleting a post does not qualify as a reason to repost, and is not permitted unless directed by a moderator. Deleting a thread after it has been removed extends any waiting periods to 7 days.6. Solicitation \ta. /c/selltrade is not here for advertising or collaborating.\tb. Linking to your item on any other market or outlet is forbidden. This means no eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, Swappa or any other site or trading forum.\tc. Do not make a thread to promote or advertise group buy sites such as Massdrop etc.\td. Soliciting your items on another users thread is forbidden. This is referred to as thread hijacking.\te. Begging, sob stories, or other manipulative means of obtaining, selling, or trading (including for free or for discounts) is prohibited. Context is only relevant up to a certain extent. Any extra information should not be used to gain an advantage over anyone else looking to make the same trade.7. Payment Methods \ta. Crypto Currency, Cash App, Venmo, Bank Transfers, Money Orders, Checks, Gift Cards, Site Credit, and digital goods such as game DLC or addons are not allowed as payment. Food is not allowed as a payment method. Any trades using such methods will receive a permanent ban. These items are also not allowed to be posted for sale.\tb. Straw purchases (e.g. offering to purchase an item of a buyerâ€™s choice from an online retailer for a discounted price, then drop-shipping) are not permitted.\tc. Paypal Goods & Services (Invoice) and local cash are the ONLY approved payments method on /c/selltrade. Any user asking for a different payment method in private messages should be reported to modmail and disciplinary actions will be taken.\td. Per the PayPal User Agreement, you can NOT surcharge the buyer for the seller fee.\te. PayPal's Invoice feature is the only way sellers will sell items. This is where the seller can describe and confirm exactly what condition the item is in. Description should state new or used, flaws, and inclusions or exclusions (missing cable, extra Corsair fan, etc).\tf. Paypal Friends and Family is not an acceptable payment method on /c/selltrade. If you are friends with somebody, and choose to use Friends and Family, flair will not be granted for such trades. This payment method offers no protection and is vulnerable to chargebacks and fraud. Users who request PayPal Friends and Family will receive permanent bans.\tg. Scammers will often lie stating that services such as Venmo, Cash App, Bank Transfers (QuickPay, Zelle, EMT), F&F, etc have buyer protection but this is a lie. None of these offer buyer protection and will not give your money back if you are scammed.\th. Traditional trades where users ship each other items must involve using PayPal Goods and Services to back your trades. Buy each other's items with G&S for an amount proportional to the items' worth (used or new where applicable). Once the payments clear, you should both have netted either nothing, or one user will net more in the event of an uneven trade plus extra money. Failure to do so not only results in a ban, but one of the two traders are likely to lose their item to scamming.8. Never Delete Posts \ta. Never delete a post unless a moderator of /c/selltrade gives you permission to do so.\tb. Threads give references for future sales to look back on. When you have sold your item(s), bought your item, or completed a trade simply edit the post stating the sale price, and who you sold the item to, and when all items are sold you can change the flair for that post to Closed.\tc. When you delete a thread we can not easily determine why your post was removed. So we may ask you to wait to post again after 7 days.\td. Our bot uses posts to determine if your account if trustworthy or not. Accounts where there are numerous deleted threads can not only trigger spam filters that are in place, but it may also cause the bot to not interact with your post properly the next time.\te. A big plus of our community is that we can see what other sellers/buyers are up to. It helps us keep a certain level of transparency in the community, and helps us learn to trust one another (those that deserve it anyways), which is what makes it so powerful.9. Giveaway Posts \ta. Giveaway posts are permitted only when approved by a mod via modmail request.\tb. Giveaways must include free shipping - no money should be given to you at the end of the Giveaway.\tc.The use of Raffler is mandatory for selecting a winner.\td. Users who participate in the raffle must have an account that is at least 50 days old or have at least 100 comment karma.\te. Users who want to offer giveaways or free items must read this post"
