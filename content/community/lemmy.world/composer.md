description: "A place for posting and discussing your score-based music.For music theory questions, check out our good friends over at !musictheory@lemmy.world.Rules for the sub:**Always provide a score if you are posting music:**A SCORE MUST BE PROVIDED. Audio is optional. Graphic scores are welcome; a score is defined as anything which is intended for a performer to interpret and read from. A screenshot of your DAW project or piano roll is not a graphic score.**Posting a commission:**All commission posts must include a single line of text at the end providing concise information on compensation. If it's unpaid you can specify that. Any commissions which violate this rule will be removed.**Tone and Civility:**All posts and comments should be respectful and courteous. Composers are here to learn or to help one another; insulting and bashing is not in the spirit of education or supporting fellow artists and will not be accepted. Disagreements are welcome; hostility is not.One word answers/comments often lead to hostile reactions while at the same time adding absolutely nothing to the overall discussion. They will be removed at the discretion of the moderators."
