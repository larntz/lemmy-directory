Use the article's title as the title of your post**Off-topic:** - Keep posts and comments relevant to the device in general, news about new developments and AR/VR on Apple's platforms**Bootstrapping:**- For the time being, to bootstrap the community, crossposts of archived Reddit posts by [the Lemmit bot](https://lemmit.online/c/about) that show up in !applevisionpro@lemmit.online and !visionpro@lemmit.online are allowed  - Try to be logical about crossposts   - Crossposting questions the answer to which would only specifically benefit the OP (who is on Reddit and can't read replies), is useless  - Crossposting questions that could lead to comments with information that would benefit members of the community are fine  - Lemmit crossposts need to be tagged with [Lemmit]---"
