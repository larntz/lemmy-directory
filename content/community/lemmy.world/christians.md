description: "Hello! This is a community of Christians for Christians. It is a place to share theology, encourage one another, and build healthy online relationships. We seek to honor Christ and fellowship with one another, discussing our daily lives and current events through a Christian lens.**Rule #1**: Let love rule all you do. “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” - John 13:34-35**Rule #2**: Believe the best about others' intentions unless truly proven otherwise. In other words, if there are two ways to interpret what someone says, one that paints that person in a charitable light and one that does not, choose the former.**Rule #3**: Keep content SFW. This is absolutely not a NSWF sub. While it is true that some difficult topics may come up that require adult conversations, that is not the same thing as being lewd, provocative, or titillating.**Rule #4**: Keep it about Jesus. Remember, this is a place for Christians - Christ-followers - so our focus is to be on Him and the work He has done in and through our lives and the Church throughout history. Everything we say or do should glorify Him.**Rule #5**: Remember that we are all fellow image-bearers. We may disagree with people, but we are never to tear down another person's inherent dignity and value as someone made in the image of God (Imago Dei). *This includes those in the LGBTQ+ community.* They need Jesus, too, just like we do, and we can't say we represent Him while we tear down the works of His hands.**Rule #6**: Banned subjects include pro-Nazi and/or pro-racist sentiments; support for conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon, International Jewish Conspiracy, Holocaust denialism, etc.; is X the mark of the Beast? drivel; anything calling for direct/indirect violence against any individual or group, including LGBTQ+ individuals or groups; pornography of any kind; gore; spam; asking for money; pro-Mormon and/or pro-Jehovah's Witness posts.**Rule #7**: To be considered a Christian in the context of this community, you must, at minimum, affirm the Nicene Creed. This community is not affiliated with or supporting a particular denomination; however, we do affirm the general inerrancy of scripture and salvation through Christ alone.**Rule #8**: This community does not affirm practiced LGBTQ+ lifestyles, with the exception of the ace lifestyle in certain contexts. However, abuse towards members of the LGBTQ+ community will not be tolerated. Pro-LGBTQ+ content is not allowed; however, sincere questions and discourse about LGTBQ+issues are permitted."
