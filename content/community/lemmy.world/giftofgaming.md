description: "A Lemmy community dedicated to host video game giveaways.**Rules:**- The only posts allowed on this community are giveaways, no making posts begging for games.- It is highly encouraged that you don't post any game keys themselves, bots are easily able to claim them instantly.- Remember to mark your giveaway as complete when you have finished it. You can do so by adding (COMPLETE) to the beginning of the title of your post.**Safety Advice:**- Do not click on any links you receive in your DMs. Giveaway operators should only be gifting games in the form of product keys sent directly to the winner's DMs. "
