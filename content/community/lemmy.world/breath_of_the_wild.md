description: "# Rules&nbsp;**1. stay civil**This is a place for friendly discussion, funny memes, useful guides, stunning art, gameplay questions etc. but witch hunting, discrimination and harrassment won't be tolerated.**2. mark spoilers**It is okay to post about related games (such as Age of Calamity and Tears of the Kingdom) but please use the spoiler censor and do not put spoilers directly into the title, as the censor doesn't work this way. Posts about other Zelda games might be suited better for other subs.**3. offtopic posts**Anything not related to BotW, like politics, religion, non-Zelda games etc. is better suited elsewhere and will be removed. The same goes for porn.**4. no merchandise**Reddit had a big problem with scammers trying to sell counterfeit merch with stolen artworks. To avoid this, merchandise as a whole will not allowed here ATM and such posts will be removed.**5. provide sources**If you're going to post art, comics, videos, screenshots etc. that are not your own OC, please mention the name of the original creator and ideally also a link to their portfolio/website. (Pinterest is almost never the original source)**6. suggestions are welcome!**This community is still brand new and I want to make it as convenient as possible for the community to participate. Feedback for improvements and constructive criticism are always welcome ;)"
