description: "In a modern world driven by the 'user experience' why do we continue to implement public benches with little thought for the end user? Is the bench next to a highway? What a great place to relax! ðŸ˜¡Is the bench facing a hedge? What a great view! ðŸ˜¡Bad Benches is a community for sharing images of poorly implemented benches that are failing to serve their purpose and/or offer the public a poor user experience.Rule #1 - Your post must include an image of a bench or seating installation designed for public use.Rule #2 - Your post must indicate why you think it's a bad bench."
