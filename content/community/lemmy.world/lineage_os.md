description: "The community for the Lineage OS.### Rules#### Do not ask for an ETADon't ask for the estimate time of arrival of builds for a device. Builds will come when ready. Don't ask about future plans, updates, developments, or news. We don't have crystal balls, schedules, or grand strategies that dictate when or if things will happen.#### Do not ask whether your device will be supportedWhether a device will supported depends on whether a maintainer or a contributor has the device and intends to bring it up. Don't ask if builds for another device will work on your unsupported device. Don't ask where builds for a previously supported device are. Don't state that you're waiting for builds for an unsupported device. Don't ask if a supported device will be supported on a newer version. Don't ask for support on un-supported devices.#### Do not beg for VoLTENot all devices with LTE are VoLTE-capable.#### Do not post bug reportsWe have a separate bug tracker. Please see the instructions on [the wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/how-to/bugreport) regarding how to report bugs correctly.#### Don't ask for help with non-Lineage ROMsThis community is for LineageOS. If you have a problem with a non-LineageOS ROM, ask elsewhere. This also extends to asking for ROM suggestions.#### Do not ask for features to be addedWe are not accepting feature requests in this subreddit, on GitLab, or anywhere else at this time. If you have implemented a new feature we accept patches through Gerrit at http://review.lineageos.org#### Don't ask about unsupported mods* Magisk modifies the boot image* MicroG requires signature spoofing* Substratum modifies frameworks* SuperSU is not a supported root access manager* Xposed breaks the Android APIs  We can't help with these things because we don't control them and we can't support devices with them installed because they modify the OS at a deep level and they may open security holes.#### Don't link to or discuss unofficial builds or sitesPlease don't post links to unofficial builds or unofficial news sources. If it's not lineageos.org -- it's not official."
