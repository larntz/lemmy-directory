description: " **Not official just like the stories and would like some authors to come here**         **Copy and pasted from the subreddit would need to changed.**What is humans are space orcs and why are so many people so passonate about it?    How is this sub different to r/hfyWelcome to the r/humansarespaceorcs FAQ! This is for users who are unfamiliar with the trope and also to address questions that are commonly asked. Currently, it is very short, however with time this may expand with updates as this sub grows larger. Just remember that this is subject to change which will be notified as a mod post.What is humans are space orcs and why are so many people so passonate about it?The humans are space orcs trope is the writing trope involving aliens and humans, however unlike normal writing tropes, the humans are VASTLY different and superior the aliens. This doesnt have to just be in physical strenght, it could be in inteligence, a weird way we chose to do something, sometimes technological superiority, etc. We dont have to be superior in the story for it to follow the trope, we just have to be different from the aliens. This allows things such as the aliens simply being confused about something we do (or a lot of things we do) dispite them being superior to us. Many people dont like this trope because its unrealilistic, but usualy when people complain its because they thing we actualy think this will be true. We dont. We do this so that we can have fun stories about ourselves while acknowledging how unlikly it is.How is this sub different to r/hfyIf you dont know, r/hfy is another subreddit following the same trope. The difference is mostly in our allowance of writingprompts and lower effort stories. Most stories on r/hfy were written proffesionaly/they were written by someone who possibly spent days thinking and planning the story. They do allow the kinds of stories we get on this subreddit, but its rarer. On our subreddit most stories (not all! They sometimes could have taken days as well, or sometimes written proffessionaly.) are written within 30 minutes, and sometimes its written as simply a script.Here is an example of how simple it can be sometimes:human: says somethingAlien: asks question about whyhuman: says something complelty insane but humans find normalaliens: horrifiedSometimes it can follow this exact format. This kind of post is allowed on r/hfy however it is much less popular and sometimes just downvoted to oblivion. Our subreddit has that kind of thing reaching popular, because it is a simple interaction that can be made to have a part two, so others can easily share their ideas in the replys without having to write a full story. Of course, this isnt the only thing we get on this subreddit and we also have full length serials sometimes.The other difference is our allowance of writingprompts. r/hfy does have a Writing Prompt Wednesday where the mods have a post on Wednesday and people reply with their writingprompts, but this is only allowed in the comments. This causes hundreds of writingprompts to be buried and never get a reply. On our subreddit, you can post full writingprompt posts so long as you read the rules on how to correctly post them, which are in the wiki. This, combined with the much smaller state of this subreddit, allowes for every post to be seen usualy within a day, without posts being buried.Thank you for reading the FAQ! If you have any more questions please either make a post with the meta flair or simply modmail. A meta post will always get a faster response however modmail may be more accurate depending on the question."
