description: "A place for news and discussion about adult animation.**What is adult animation?**Animated shows, shorts, or movies aimed at audiences 13+.**What is it not?**Animated 18+, X-rated pornography or hentai.RULES1. **No bigotry** (sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia).2. **Meme Monday.** Memes are only allowed on Mondays. I'd like this community to be more news/ discussion/ recommendation based.3. **Anime Tuesday and Thursday.** There is an abundance of communities across the web dedicated to anime, so ideally, it would be nice if anime did not dominate this one. That said, I, and many others, enjoy some anime and wouldn't mind hearing about it occasionally. Please keep posts pertaining to anime to Tuesdays and Thursdays. That does not mean only anime posts those days; non-anime posts are still allowed too. [Note: Anime means animation originating from Japan. It does not mean animation originating from other Asian countries or Western animation that uses an anime style of art; those would be considered non-anime and are welcome anytime.]4. **Be civil, kind, and try to stay positive.** Not every show is for everyone and you're free to give a critique; someone giving reasons why they didn't enjoy something may help others decide if it's for them. However, if people are discussing a show and you come along just to say, 'This sucks, I hate it.' that's just being negative and unhelpful- Please don't. Try just not venturing into posts about shows you personally despise.Full disclosure- I have never moderated a community before. I started this because it's something I would like to see. If it picks up and I can't keep up, or whatever, I would be open to turning over the reigns to someone else."
