name: "logoedits"
description: "# IntroductionThis community aims to be a continuation / adoption of the logo-editing Sbubby tradition of Reddit.You can submit edits of a logo that does not resemble a patchy hack job of mish-mashing letters together.# Rules for guidance:* Keep posts safe for work.* Keep the logos in a readable quality and be sure to export the final product with minimal compression artifacts if possible.* Make sure that the logo you're editing is above 200x200px in size.* You can indicate whether your post is a logoswap, nonsensical edit, or other type, but you need to indicate the source brand whose logo is edited.* Chain posts of logos can also be done if it's non-intrusive to normal posts.* Keep reposts to zero.* And for a good measure, remember that you don't need to hoard votes for your posts, and have fun editing logos.
