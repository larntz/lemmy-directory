title: "Gaslighting" 
name: "gaslighting"
description: "You remember those occasions when you bring up a bit of factual news in discussion with a friend or coworker.  They have no idea what you are talking about.  Those are the people who get all their news from the mainstream media.  They never or hardly ever take the time to actually research issues on their own.  And many of those use a search engine that has unashamedly come out and told you that they use logarithms to suppress factual news that they don't like.  For them anything that disagrees with their world view is mis information. The purpose of this group is to post and discuss that factual news hidden, dismissed, or distorted by the media in an effort to get others to think for themselves and find the truth.  Instead of digging for the truth the media now engages in Gaslighting which is defined as a form of psychological abuse in which a person or group causes someone to question their own sanity and perception of reality.  Because if you are told a lie over and over again the lie becomes reality."
