title: "Ghost Song" 
name: "ghostsong"
description: "Ghost Song is a 2D metroidvania style game that not only gives players that feeling of isolation and minimalism Super Metroid fans long for, but also delivers an emotionally powerful story. This story is told not through pages of exposition or long cut scenes, but through being in the game, being in the moment, and observing events as they unfold. It's a highly ambient, atmospheric approach to story that falls somewhere between Super Metroid and Dark Souls in its tenor.https://store.steampowered.com/app/347800/Ghost_Song/"
