description: "A place to share your favorite beat poetry and creative writing for review and discussion, and a place for weary travelers to share their thoughts.Original content is encouraged.When I made this I was unsure what it would even be. I've settled on something near to my heart: beat poetry, creative writing and the nitty gritty of the human experience and our place in the world. I don't mind modding, but I'm still learning. Talk about whatever, dont be an ass, and be mindful.  We'll make more defined rules as we go, and the community will decide what this place becomes. "
