description: "Welcome to Pumparum!This community is here as an alternative to r/pumparum. For those who did not know what that is, this community is for post trade requests, if you need something someone else probably has it and can trade it with you, they may also want something, so help them out too!This sub is aimed at DS3 requests because it's much easier to help with requests through the use of multiplayer passwords in the [system] > [network], with this you can bypass the soul level requirements the previous games had. **PLEASE DO NOT POST PASSWORDS IN PUBLIC AND POST THEM IN PMs JUST TO BE SAFE**The post format for ease should follow something along the lines of:[Platform] W(ant): {items you want}, H(ave): {items you are offering as trade}Example:[PC] W: Lothric Knight Greatsword +10, H: Symbol of Avarice/Ask/MuleKeep in mind that [certain items cannot be traded](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Player+Trade), this includes; upgrade materials, spells, covenant offerings, key items, spells and boss souls. Weapons, shields, talisman and staves etc. can be transferred regardless of infusion but if upgraded at all the person receiving it must have also reached that upgraded level at some point. For example, if someone is looking for a Lothric Knight Greatsword +10, they would have had to have a +10 weapon before on that same character to be able to see the drop. If the weapon in question is special and the max level is +5, it's the same rules except you double/half the upgrade level requirement (i.e. +6 normal becomes +3 special and a +3 special allows up to a +6 normal)."
