description: "I noticed there wasn't a TST Lemmy community.  The Satanic Temple is a modern satanic religion that aims to promote human rights and compassion.  Check out their about page on their official website at https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/about-us.  Note that this community is not an official affiliation.  TST is also separate and not affiliated with the Church of Satan, who have a slightly different viewpoint of what satanism truly is.  Dunno what to post in here, but maybe some will search for this and take part.  Hello!"
