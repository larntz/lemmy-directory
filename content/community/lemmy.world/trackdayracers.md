description: "A place to discuss driving on track.  Whether you're an experienced SCCA racer, a newbie in Lemons, or just want to try out autocross, this is the place for you!   WRL, Champcar, or one of the myriad trackday organizations, are all welcome here.  Please refrain from discussing any illegal activities such as street racing.    Need help in dialing in your suspension?  Picking brake pads for your application?  Track reviews, car discussion and more!    Trade stories and help, not paint!  All models and makes welcome!"
