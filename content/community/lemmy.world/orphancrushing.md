description: "A community featuring uplifting and wholesome news stories that overlook deeply ingrained systemic problems.The rules:**1. Your post must be an unironic presentation of a wholesome story, but one that overlooks systemic failures that made the story possible in the first place.** In other words, we want posts that highlight Yay, the problem is solved!, but ignore Wait, why was this a problem in the first place? at the same time.**2. Re-posts will be removed at mod discretion.****3. [Sitewide rules](https://mastodon.world/about) apply.** Basically, (a) don't be a dick; (b) use the NSFW tag; (c) no spam; (d) don't attack people; and (e) don't abuse the report button."
