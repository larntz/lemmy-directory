description: "# AboutVideos that give you a new perspective. Post your favorites! Watch them over a meal, or when you're slacking at work. Video essay is loose genre classification for a type of video that makes an argument or critique, or explains a point of view, usually from a single creator's perspective. They can be short or long, casual or formal, modest or theatrical, and cover any topic.Video essays are slightly different from documentaries, media reviews, and video journalism, but the lines are blurry, and videos that aren't neatly classifiable are still welcome.# What to PostAll top-level posts should be a link to a video essay that isn't hosted behind a paywall. In the post title, include the title of the video, its creator, and its duration using the format [MM:SS] or [HH:MM:SS]. Any subject is welcome, provided it doesn't break one of the rules.# Rules**1. Be nice**Be respectful and constructive. No harassment. No grossly offensive images. No hate including expressions of racism, misogyny, transphobia, ableism, xenophobia, etc. (although videos where these topics are merely being analyzed are okay) **2. No shitposts**Noticeably low-quality content and videos that stretch any reasonable definition of video essay will be removed. If you're not trying to break this rule, you probably aren't.**3. No spam**Don't post the same video multiple times in a short time frame. Don't flood the community with many videos from a single creator at once."
