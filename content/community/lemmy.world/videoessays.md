description: "# AboutVideos that give you a new perspective. Here you'll find videos that range all the way from bite-sized snacks to a multi-hour deep dives into the strangest rabbit holes you never even knew you cared about. Video essay is loose genre classification for a type of video that makes an argument or critique, or explains a point of view, usually from a single creator's perspective. They can be short or long, casual or formal, modest or theatrical, and cover any topic.Video essays are slightly different from documentaries, media reviews, and video journalism, but the lines are blurry, and videos that aren't neatly classifiable are still welcome. For vids under an hour, they may also fit well in [/c/mealtimevideos](/c/mealtimevideos@lemmy.world).# Rules**1. Content of posts**All top-level posts should be a link to a video essay that isn't hosted behind a paywall. Any topic is welcome, provided it doesn't break one of the other rules.**2. Title format**Each post title should include the title of the video, its creator, and its duration in the format [MM:SS] or [HH:MM:SS].**3. Be nice**Be respectful and constructive. No harassment. No grossly offensive images. No hate including expressions of racism, misogyny, transphobia, ableism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc. (although videos where these topics are merely being analyzed are okay). **4. No shitposts**Noticeably low-quality content and videos that stretch any reasonable definition of video essay will be removed. If you're not trying to break this rule, you probably aren't.**5. No spam**Don't post the same video multiple times in a short time frame. Don't flood the community with many videos from a single creator at once."
