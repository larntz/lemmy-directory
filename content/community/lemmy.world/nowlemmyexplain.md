description: "Inspired by r/eli5 and Casually Explained.**Now Lemmy Explain: Starting the Now Lemmy Explain community.**I've always felt like the name Explain It Like I'm 5 is patronizing (yes, I know, it's from an Office joke). I want to see a community that's better and more entertaining to read than how it was on reddit. **Now Lemmy Explain: The Rules:**1. All post title must start with **Now Lemmy Explain: **2. All topics are allowed (within reason) but try to avoid ones that will start a flame war.3. Keep your explanation concise and entertaining. Remember though, comedy is subjective. 4. Be excellent to one another, and have fun."
