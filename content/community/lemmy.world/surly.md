description: "For all fans of the Surly Bikes brand and bikes.Many have tried — and failed — to define **[Surly](https://surlybikes.com)**. Contrary to popular belief, we’re not a bunch of deranged, clown-obsessed, serial killer wannabes — well, not all of us. We’re not drunk 24/7 and we don’t live in the woods behind our office anymore. What we are is an assortment of personalities and humanoids all brought together by one common interest: bike nerdom. *We make serious steel bikes for people who don’t take themselves too seriously.*(Source: https://surlybikes.com/about_surly)*[Community rules](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/code_of_conduct.html) you ask? Just be a positive humanoid, don't be a whining SOB. Ride your bike. Tell good stories. Share epic pics.*"
