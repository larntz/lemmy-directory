description: "**About us**Veganism is a way of living that is just awesome, plus we totally get enough protein! Also, we totally get enough oral sex. Probably more than you, to be honest. Not bragging, just stating facts. - The Vegan Society______________________________________________They asked me to be careful and I was confused as to why, my b12 count has never been higher! - John______________________________________________Dominion is horror filmmaking at its absolute finest. - IMDB**Rules**1. No meatflakes or meatflake ApologistsAbsolutely under no circumstances are meatflakes allowed to freely participate in this community. Meatflakes/Carnists includes all persons who are not ethical vegans. We do not condone carnist coddling and hand-holding of any sort. This includes no advocating for animal deaths. The right to an animals life is non-negotiable. No advocating in favor of animal testing, death, or mass euthanasia.2. No Non-Leftists, Health and/or Environmental VegansVeganism is a leftist social justice movement for animal liberation. It is not a diet for your health and it is not for the human environment. This also, obviously, means No slurs/bigotry, Why would you even want to? 3. No support of PBCWe do not condone or advocate for plant based capitalism. We will never support animal agriculture companies, or any business that exists to extract profit from vegans while funding animal exploitation. We are frustrated these businesses have infiltrated every vegan space and being represented online by ads for TVP and first world convenience food. We're not here to make food aisles bigger, this is about animal liberation. We have all had this convo already which leads us to rule 54. No Debates/Serious DiscussionThis is a community for memes for vegans and by vegans. There are lots of other places where you can have your debates.5. No Hero Worship, Influencers or MarketingThis is a community to jerk about veganism, not a place to promote your ego, new products, or embarrass yourself worshiping a YouTuber. If it is going to a good veganism related cause then message us and it will be approved at our discretion.6. No Meta PostingMeta posting is usually very boring and not fit for a meme subreddit. I wish I could extend this to all the other vegan subreddits. If you really need to post meta about something with circlejerk in the name get a grip and delete your account"
