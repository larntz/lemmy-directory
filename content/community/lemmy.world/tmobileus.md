Examples might include the full name of any T-Mo employee who helped you, or something that could be used to put their job in jeopardy.2. Keep it coolSimple. Just be excellent to each other. Don't get too heated, don't start tossing ad hominem attacks at people. Focus on the subject, not the person making the point.

Non-T-Mobile posts are allowed if the goal is a discussion about T-Mobile. Direct links to other carrier's advertisements or press releases will likely be removed.
