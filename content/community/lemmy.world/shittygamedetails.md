description: "Share your favorite videogame details, potentially with a shitty twist.To be clear, this is a place for satirical and meta^2^ references. Not really the actual game details, unless they're truly stupid or have strong meme potential/background. Arrow in the knee kind of stuff. Tho sometimes even these can span a good debate.For maximum funni, include full name of the game, its release date and all the detail right in the title of the post.Try to avoid actual shit and other nasty stuff. Mark nsfw when appropriate.For shitty movie details, there's [!shittymoviedetails@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/shittymoviedetails)  [Local_link](/c/shittymoviedetails@lemmy.world)Regular rules of lemmy.world apply."
