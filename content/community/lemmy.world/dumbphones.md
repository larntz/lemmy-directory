But have ***we*** become smarter by using them?This community is oriented for people who prefer either so-called dumbphones or feature phones in order to regain control of their life.Here is a very simple set of rules to follow:1. Don't be rude to others.2. Don't harass or shame somebody for not being hardcore dumbphones fan. Everybody does it his own way.3. Keep this community simple: discussions must be dumbphone or smartphone-oriented, not about dogs or food.All in all, enjoy your time here :D"
