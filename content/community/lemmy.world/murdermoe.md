No depictions of murder or excessive violence, the point is to appreciate the character and her readiness to fight, not any gore they perpetrate3. If posting a more suggestive piece, or one with simply a lot of skin, consider still marking it nsfw4. Include a link to the artist in post body, if you can5. No AI generated content6.
