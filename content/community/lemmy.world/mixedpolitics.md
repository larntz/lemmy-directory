title: "Mixed Politics" 
name: "mixedpolitics"
description: "Mixed Politics is intended to function as neutral ground for Americans of opposing political parties to step out of their echo chambers (even if temporarily), coexist civilly in the same space as the other side, and have normal, human interactions with each other. Wihile this will likely will be a community that requires heavy moderation to to keep it in within the spirit of the design, it feels like it's something worth trying. Please don't ruin it on purpose. #### RULESAbove all: **Be Excellent To Each Other.**1) **You aren't here to prove points to the other side.** Don't go out of your way to back people into corners. Ask questions and provide counterpoints, but be mindful of tone and direction. Determining a victor isn't the point of the discussions here. 2) **Posts don't have to be about politics.** Finding common ground on anything is a win, even if it's something as simple as enjoyment of a TV show.3) **No trolling, baiting, concern-trolling, sea lioning, straw-manning**, or any of the other dishonest tactics that serve to accomplish little beyond alienating and pissing off whoever you're speaking to. Participate in good faith, and until given evidence to the contrary assume others are doing likewise.4) **No personal attacks. Address the position, not the person.** Posts containing personal attacks or attempts to draw in unrelated information, such as a user's post history, to discredit them, are to be avoided. 5) **No slurs.** There are pretty much zero circumstances under which using a slur serves a valid purpose here.6) Piggybacked off Rule 4, **not everyone will agree on which terms are slurs** and which aren't, particularly as the purpose of the community is to deliberately cross party/cultural lines. To address this disparity, **when someone asks that a term not be used to refer to them or a group of people, don't do it again after that point.** If you've been asked and continue to do it, Rule 4 comes into play.7) **Avoid flooding/repetitive topics.** Check if a topic already exists before posting, and if it does leave a comment in that post rather than create a new one.9) **Don't be the reason we need more rules!**"
