description: "Just a general community for talking about issues relating to sleep apnea (central, obstructive, and complex cases welcome), as well as treatments for sleep apnea, such as (but not limited to) CPAP, APAP, BiPAP, ASV, and dental fixtures (such as MAD's).Rules: Treat all others with respect. Currently not allowing sales of CPAP/APAP/BiPAP/ASV machines and supplies such as full mask sets (some countries require scripts on such items, so it's not something I want to try my luck on). Also want to do my best to follow the general rules of this instance.Mods: Just me at the moment. If others sub and post/comment frequently, I may link up an application of sorts or ask others who seem to be kind and civil in discussion if they want to help mod."
