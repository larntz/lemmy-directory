description: "My name is Commander Shepard and this is my favorite Mass Effect community on the citadel.**Rules & Regs:**1. Don't be a dick, unless it's a really spicy renegade interrupt. But even then, seriously, don't be a dick.2. Memes are great - seriously, I need more Mass Effect sh!tposting in my life. 3. This is a welcoming community for all stripes, let's just remember there's people on the other side of the screen and act accordingly. 4. If you're here, you gotta post. Thems the breaks, kid.**Other stuff:**- I hope to welcome all Rexxitors from r/masseffect, though this is not in any official way associated with them. Still, they're great, and Mass Effect is great, so I hope all Reddit orphans can find a cozy place here to talk about whether or not Leviathan of Dis is going to pull some shady ish. "
