title: "Intactivism" 
name: "intactivism"
description: "Intactivism is a movement for bringing about sociopolitical change to ensure people have the right to bodily integrity. Female, intersex, and male genital mutilation are grave violations of this right. Genital mutilation, for which circumcision is a euphemism, is cruel and barbaric. It is especially heinous as the genitals are a private and intimate part of the human body and are immensely important for the sexual and overall human experience."
