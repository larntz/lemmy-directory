description: "A community for posting the dramatic controversies and significant slapfights that occur within hobby circles, the more niche the hobby the better.As described by [/r/HobbyDrama](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/):> Hobby Drama is an event which happens in a hobby that creates meaningful controversy. Hobby Drama-worthy events might have ousted someone from the community, shaped perception of the hobby, altered the rules the hobby uses, divided the community, created a new faction, caused significant outrage, etc. They are not blink-and-you'll-miss-it catfights with no consequences or internet influencers being rude to each other.> > What is not a hobby? What is NOT Hobby Drama?> > Most drama between professionals is not hobby drama, e.g. professional sports teams, YouTubers, streamers, actors, scientists, etc., unless the professionals are interacting with hobbyists/fans. Current events, news, real-world politics, following a social media account, and being internet famous do not qualify as hobbies. Mods reserve the right to make exceptions for particularly bizarre or niche write-ups.> > Drama must have active involvement by hobbyists to qualify as hobby drama. It cannot be a contained event between professionals where hobbyists had no involvement or no impact on the perception of the occurrence. A TV show finale being bad isn't hobby drama; the fandom reaction leading to it being called 'the worst TV finale ever' might be.> > What is a Hobby Drama post?> > A high-quality, well thought-out post about a dramatic event in a hobby space. Readers overwhelmingly prefer posts which lay out the history, stakes, events, and consequences of the drama, and which include receipts like screenshots or chat logs. Posts should have minimal direct involvement by the poster and not be overwhelmingly biased, and any personal information of participants who are not public figures must be censored.> > What is NOT a Hobby Drama post?> > A short paragraph, one liner, a post directly asking for advice or a post that is fabricated or fictional. Please see the wiki for more information.### RULES1. Be excellent to each other. Keep it kind, or at least civil.2. Redact all personal information.3. Wait for the drama to (mostly) conclude before posting about it. We like endings.4. The consequences of the drama should be included in the post.5. If personally involved in the drama, don't post about it. No validation seeking.6. Mark NSFW posts NSFW."
