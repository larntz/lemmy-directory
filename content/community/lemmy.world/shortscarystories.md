description: "Welcome to Short Scary Stories!**House Rules**1    All stories must be 500 words or less. The go-to source that mods use to check stories is www.wordcounter.net. All of the story must be in the post itself, and not be carried on in the title of the story or in the comment section.2   Stories cannot have links in them. This is meant to reduce distractions. Any story with a link in it will be removed.3   We do not require trigger warnings here as other rules cover subject matters which may be harmful to readers. Additionally, emojis and other non-text items are not allowed in the title.4   No Non-Story Text Within the Story. No comments about it being your first post, or repeating the title within the story text, no side mentions of your inspiration. Just the narrative by itself. You have the comment section to host any commentary you have on it.5    No multi-part stories, no sequels, prequels, interquels, alternative viewpoint stories, links to previous stories for reference, or anything that builds off of or depends on some other story you’ve written. The story begins and ends within the 500 words or less you are allotted.6    Self-Promotion can only be done in the comment section of the story. Authors may only link to personal Lemmy communities, and YouTube narrations of the work currently posted. Links to sales sites such as Amazon or posts with the intent of generating sales are strictly forbidden. No links to outsides websites like blogs, author websites, or anything else.7    We ask that authors focus on creating stories within horror and thriller stories. You may borrow from other genres, but the main focus of the story MUST be to horrify, scare, or unsettle. Stories with jokey punchline will be removed. We shouldn't be laughing at the end of the story. Stories dealing with depression, suicide, mental illness, medical ailments, and other assorted topics can be part of your stories, but mind the delicate balance between something horrifying and sad. If we can interpret the story as being scary, we will do so.8   All stories must be an original work. Stories must be submitted by the authors who wrote the story. Do not steal other users' stories. This rule also applies to famous or common stories that you’ve merely reworded slightly. This does not apply to famous stories you’ve reworked considerably, such as a fresh take on a fairytale or urban legend. No fan fiction allow. Stories generated via AI are not allowed. Stories based on copyrighted materials will be removed as well. The rule of thumb is that the original your story is, the safer you'll be.9    Rape/Pedophilia/Bestiality/Torture Porn/Gore Porn are Off-Limit Topics. The intent of this ban is to prevent bad actors from exploiting this sub as a delivery system for their fantasies, which would bring the tone down, and alienate the reader base who don’t want to be exposed to such material. reason is that if we let in the decent stories with such content, those bad actors can point at them and demand to know why those stories get to stay and not theirs. Better by far to head the issue off entirely with a hard ban and stick to it.10    Authors must wait 2 hours between submissions. This is intended to prevent prolific writers from crowding out others from the front page by spamming the sub. It is likely if you mistime it, you’ll be able to copy/paste and resubmit your story once the 2 hours has passed.11    We reserve the right to remove any story that fails to use proper grammar, has frequent typos, or is in general just a poorly composed story. This is relative, and we will use that right as sparingly as possible.12    This includes, but is not limited to: bigotry/hate speech, personal insults, exceptionally low quality feedback, antagonistic behavior, use of slurs, etc. Use your best judgement. Mod response will take the form of a spectrum ranging from a mild warning to a permaban, depending on the context. Incidentally, the lowest response we have to mod abuse is banning, because we quite literally don’t need to put up with it.13    Posts impersonating specific subreddit/community posting styles like /r/AITA, /r/Relationships, /r/Advice, are not allowed on SSS. If there's commentary about confusion in the comment section, your story might be removed."
