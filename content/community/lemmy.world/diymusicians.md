Hopefully a place to foster collaboration and inspiration, as well as to showcase projects from less popular musicians.Currently with a focus on – but not limited to – lofi, bedroom pop, shoegaze, punk, post-punk, emo, noise rock, garage rock, indie rock, indie folk. Really anything breaking the mold and not afraid to get a bit weird! "
