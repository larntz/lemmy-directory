description: "A Place to discuss drama in the online creator space. This is retaining the spirit of the original subreddit. This includes drama pertaining across multiple platforms, not just youtube but it could include twitch, kick, rumble, tiktok, twitter and more. Remember, whilst we do discuss drama topics that relate to public figures we do not condone harassment, doxing, stalking and other illegal actions against these creators....Update by retaining the spirit of the original subreddit, I should state minus weird mod behaviour!"
