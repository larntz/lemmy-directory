description: "**Slice of Life Anime**- No NSFW allowed!- Cite your sources!- Keep it wholesome!- Refrain from politics!- Language is English but Japanese titles and short comments eg. かわいい！ is allowed.This is because my Japanese is shit and thus I cannot moderate it effectively.- Mainly for 'pure' slice of life and not romance (that's it's own genre). think:  - Lucky Star (らき☆すた)  - Nichijou (日常)  - Azumanga Daioh (あずまんが大王)  - K-ON! (けいおん!)  - etcWhy?There are no substitutes for subs like r/luckystar on Lemmy.I can hardly make all the separate subs into separate communities on Lemmy.Lemmy currently does not enjoy a big enough user base where such niche topics can exist independently and still be active.Thus I created a place to aggregate these similar interests."
