description: "# **Slice of Life Anime**- **No NSFW allowed!**- **Cite your sources!**- **Keep it wholesome!**- **Refrain from politics!**- **Language is English** but Japanese titles and short comments eg. かわいい！ are allowed.This is because my Japanese is shit and thus I cannot moderate it effectively.- **Mainly for 'pure' slice of life** and not romance (that's it's own genre). think:  - Lucky Star (らき☆すた)  - Nichijou (日常)  - Azumanga Daioh (あずまんが大王)  - K-ON! (けいおん!)  - etc  Slice of life portions of Gintama (銀魂) are allowed. - **Don't be afraid to cross post** from communities of specific slice of life anime to this one in order to aggregate slice of life content.Specific communities:- [!luckystar@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/luckystar)- [!nichijou@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/nichijou) - [!azumangadaioh@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/azumangadaioh)- [!nonnonbiyori@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/nonnonbiyori) - [!hitoribocchi@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/hitoribocchi) - [!kon@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/kon) Why?There are no substitutes for small subs on specific anime's.I can hardly make all the separate subs into separate communities on Lemmy.Lemmy currently does not enjoy a big enough user base where such niche topics can exist independently and still be active.Thus I created a place to aggregate these similar interests."
