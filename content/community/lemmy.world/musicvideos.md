description: "/c/MusicVideos is the place for music videos: Creatively produced video that matches a single song soundtrack.# Rules:::: spoiler 1. Must be an actual Music VideoThere is music and there are videos, but actual Music Videos are effortful productions with strong visual content and music together. Concert recordings don't count. Cell phone videos don't count. Webcam performances don't count. Lyric videos don't count. Slideshows don't count. ETC!1 song with a creative/produced video to match is the only thing that should be posted here! Fan-made content is okay as long as some effort is put into making something that stands alone.:::::: spoiler 2. Title must include: Artist - Title [genre] [year]All video posts must have a title that starts with the Artist Name, then a space, a single - dash, then a space, the Song Title, then a space, the genre or multiple genre tags within [ ] square brackets, then a space, the year the video was made within [ ] square brackets (omit year if N/A). Then a title can have further description or comments, such as director name or producer credit or any special description.:::"
