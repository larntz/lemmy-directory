description: "## AboutA community dedicated to the discussion of the Quran, the Sunnah and early Islam from a scholarly perspective. Here, such topics as Quranic exegesis, Biblical and extra-Biblical parallels, textual criticism, history of interpretation, pre-Islamic Arabia, etc. are discussed in a friendly yet engaging way. Original subbreddit is [r/AcademicQuran](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicQuran/). You can also join [Academic Qur’anic Studies](https://discord.com/invite/uHJwpP5QmS) on discord.## Rules#### 1. Be respectfulOn this subreddit, you will encounter people from a variety of different perspectives, Muslims and non-Muslims. Respect this fact and treat each other with kindness, always being polite even if you strongly disagree with one another. Be aware that this includes no profanity, flaming, trolling, bullying, harassing, stalking or spamming.#### 2. All content must remain within the boundaries of academic Islamic studiesThe subreddit is focused on the academic (and not traditional) study of early Islam, so all content submitted to it must remain within those boundaries. Other subs exist for traditional Islamic studies.Discussion of contemporary movements, politics, current events, inspirational quotes, prayer requests, questions regarding personal application and faith-based questions (why does God allow suffering, is anime haram, etc) are not permitted. These are valuable, this is not the place for them.#### 3. Content must not make theological claimsTheological debates and discussions (e.g. whether the Qurʾān is divinely inspired, whether non-Muslims go to Jannah) are not allowed. The purpose of this sub is not to prove or disprove theological concepts such as the existence of God, the inspiration of the Qurʾān, etc., nor is its purpose to promote the superiority of any particular ideology or religious group over another.We ask everyone here to abide by the words of Qurʾān 109:6, “‘to you your religion and to me my religion.”#### 4. Back up claims with scholarly citationsWhen discussing a particular topic, provide citations from scholarly books, journal articles or webpages in order to back up your assertions. For example, you should be able to provide a reliable citation when discussing whether an English translation of a Qurʾānic passage is correct.The information in your citation should be verifiable by other users. A translation must accompany an exclusively Arabic source. In general, the English meaning of Arabic terms should be clarified.#### 5. No citations from apologetic/counter-apologetic sourcesMaterial that comes from apologetic/counter-apologetic sources (meaning for example books, websites or videos which have a clear ideological/religious bias for or against Islam) is not acceptable, even if they cite scholary sources.True academic scholarship does not seek to confirm, discredit or mock beliefs. Rather, it is a sober, nonbiased pursuit of knowledge, which is what c/AcademicQuran and r/AcademicQuran seeks to embody and support.#### 6. No Sock PuppetsPosting as a different user when using a separate account will result in the banning of both accounts.## Useful Links(Warning: links to r/AcademicQuran on reddit)- [Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicQuran/comments/p8usa4/resources/)- [List of Journals](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicQuran/comments/nck1u0/academic_journals_and_book_publishers/)- [Literature](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicQuran/comments/nck685/select_bibliographies/)- [Archived Posts on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicQuran/comments/14a2x7e/archived_posts/)"
