description: "A community for tennis fans to discus professional tennis players, matches, tournaments, rules etc. Rules:Be nice; you can dislike a player as much as you like, but don’t call a diehard Djokovic fan a wanker (for example). Swearing in general is fine. No hate speech or porn.Try and keep the big 3 stats and charts to a minimum. We get it, they were/are the best yet. We don’t need reminding multiple times a day. "
