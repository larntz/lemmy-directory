I am simply here to spread the word of anime to the less fortunate. I think astrophysics and anime go hand in hand, like a sword and shield. Like man and woman, as G-d Himself intended for all of us when he went on that drunken bender 6000 years ago today. You don't think that fucker wasn't watching hentai? We're like his 2D, you ever think of that? Like, he's in something more than 3D, so we're like his 2D, like I just fucking said!! And he could still get it up and bust all kind of holy nuts up in them virgin guts on St. Patrick's Day way back when. That's like jerkin' it to Yoko Littner. Am I really so different, G-d!?! Why the fuck have you forsaken me? You know he didn't even pay child support for Jesus, not even once? Fuckin' piece of shit.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ಠ_ಠLegislated mandates in sentencing can create some awful tyrannies. I think we need a human dimension to sentencing because I believe that leads, overall, to more humane and constructive corrective value. As long as there is some oversight watching out for unreasonable abusers and a channel to deal with tha t, then I think we are better off in the long run. The law can't anticipate or solve every problem in advance and trying to design it to be that way would make it too unwieldy, burdensome, and in some cases potentially wildly inhumane. Three strikes laws are examples of such failure in the past.

The only reason I'm saying eh is the ending ties stuff together decently and is emotionally effective. I also liked how almost every episode had a large time jump.

The first one is the most obvious... Namely that humanity survived into the future without help the first time through... Perhaps just barely. Perhaps only after great loss and long eras of suffering. In this scenario there is no paradox. Why would the future survivors care to reach back in time and aid their struggling ancestors? These humans were apparently masters of time. Maybe from their perspectPeople seem to be overlooking the deviations from the biblical story as sort of random ignorance on the part of the filmakers. But I think these deviations are coherently intentional ... Scott's take on this film seems to have been to cast the plague miracles pretty much as if they were coincidental natural events. And Moses' conversations with God were hallucinatory episodes triggered by a head injury. These hard to believe events culminated in a rebellion by the Hebrews and provoked the one remarkable event that is hard to deny historically: namely, Ramses allowing the Hebrews to leave Egypt. Perhaps Ridley Scott is saying, in essence, Eventually the story of the Exodus got turned into a miraculous mythology. But here, dear viewer, is a plausible rendering of how it all may have really happened.ive of being able to see through all of time, everyone to them is in the present (as was apparent in the tesseract construct).

It's not. They go in the opposite direction. DMC is about a kid moving to Toky who wanted to be an indie pop act, but for some unexplained reason wound up in a death metal band that he hates.
