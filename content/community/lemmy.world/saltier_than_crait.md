description: "Are you tired of the Disney Star Wars era? Did The Last Jedi piss you off? Does the name Kathleen Kennedy or Rian Johnson grate your eardrums? This might be the place for you! I left Reddit for obvious reasons and I've been waiting for someone to come over to the Lemmy side. I'm tired of waiting and hope others can come join here. I'm very new and I don't plan on moderating because I have a family and job. But I bet some of you would love to change that! For right now, memes and discussion are encouraged at the expense of Disney's failed IP Acquisition! All the dumbness, awful, and terrible ideas are fair game! If you have some good things to say, that's okay too. A broken clock is right twice a day and certainly Disney could happen on a brilliant take once in awhile. But for those that know (we really know), they screwed up the biggest revival of our lifetime that we'll never get back!"
