This is also not a place for free readings or promoting paid readings- don‚Äôt do it. No self promotion. Additionally, be cautious about anyone getting all up in your DMs and offering: please do not give your personal information to strangers on the internet. Do not be a troll, bully or creep. This means no personal attacks, racism, misogyny, misandry, ageism or any of that hateful stuff will be tolerated. Learners of all levels may post- remember, though when responding that the person you are replying to may not be as well versed as you are. **Be kind to each other. **Though it should be covered under number 3: we don‚Äôt particularly care that you don‚Äôt believe in astrology. That‚Äôs fine, talk about it in a community not for astrology. Seems like a no-brainer to me. Please bare with us, we are also adjusting to the new format. Thank you for your patience there. :) #When posting a chart for discussion: Please be sure you black out your personally identifying information. Again, remember you are not here to get a free reading. Further understanding a particular part of a chart is fine. Try to avoid vague questions like ‚ÄúCan someone explain my chart?‚Äù instead, go with particular aspects or placements to get clearer answers. Please be sure you are also letting us know which style of chart you are working with. As we are a multi-disciplinary community, this should keep things a little more organized. Try to steer clear of the fatalistic in mundane astrology. Your moderator is a mundane astrologer- I get it, but let‚Äôs keep the doom to a low roar, best we can. "
