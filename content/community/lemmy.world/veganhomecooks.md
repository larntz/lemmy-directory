description: "Come join the Vegan Home Cooks!Veganism isn't a diet but I have to eat every day. This is for the vegan home cooks. Anything non vegan will be deleted.**Participation is really easy, just take a picture of what you cooked today and post it, no recipes needed.** This is not about how to cook it is about what we eat. No plant-based vegan-pandering capitalist crap like Impossible, Beyond, Dairy-company owned vegan cheese. Keep it as close to from-scratch as you can. Rules:**Vegan only** If it is not vegan it doesn’t belong here… or anywhere.**Home cooking only no restaurant or fast food.** This is a place for vegan home cooks. We all eat at restaurants but this is what literally every vegan space is about so post pics of your food orders somewhere else, we don’t want to promote any large or small business tyrants**No trademarked brands use generic names**. We like to figure out alternatives to expensive corporate products. We’re cooking with tvp not whatever shitty business brands it, we’re not trying to turn comrades into billboards."
