description: "A community for sharing Combat Footage.As Lemmy is still taking form, uploading videos is a bit tricky. I'm afraid using services like imgur, drag and drop file uploaders, twitter, etc would result in a lot of dead links. Especially with the nature of this type of content.I recommend you use IPFS to upload media to this community/Lemmy.Rules (WIP)- Try not to repost, see if the video you're about to post hasnt already been posted.- Only post direct video links, no articles with the video embedded from an external site for example.- Video must be viewable without the need for a account (Twitter is banned)."
