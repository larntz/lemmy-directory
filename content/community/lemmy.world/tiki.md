description: "**Description:**Tiki culture is a celebration of tropical escapism. It's a longing for the time when Pacific islands were still exotic locales that inspired Donn Beach and Trader Vic to create their own versions back home. It all started in 1934 with the first Don the Beachcomber tiki restaurant, and was rejuvenated in the mid-90's with the printing of The Book of Tiki by Sven Kirsten. Pull up a chair, sip your Mai Tai, and study the tsantsa-covered ceiling while listening to the sounds of the Hukilau.**What is tiki:**Things that are tiki: Tiki mugs. Tiki bars. Tiki cocktails. Aloha shirts. Luaus. Witco. Oceanic Arts. South Pacific culture. Trader Vic's. Don The Beachcomber. Martin Denny. Les Baxter. Mai Tais.**Things that arent tiki:**Hot rods. Lowbrow Art (Rat Fink et al). Surf music. Jimmy Buffet. Margaritas. Science Fiction.  **GENERAL RULES of the community:**-Remember the Aloha-Trolls will be sacrificed to Pele-A basic difference of opinion is not a good reason for a downvote-Spam: the canned meat product = Good Spam: the repeated self-promotion without interaction = Bad-No political discussion**Aloha**"
