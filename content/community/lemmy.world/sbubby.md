description: "Sbubby - Eef Freef!Sbubbies are images in which the text of a logo has been cleanly edited to read something different.We've altered our ruleset a bit from the subreddit, and these may change at short notice as we acclimate to Lemmy.Rules:- Be respectful of your fellow users. Be civil towards others, even if you disagree with them. Hate speech of any kind is not tolerated, including, but not limited to: racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, and transphobia.- All Sbubbies must be edits to the text of logos. A logo is a visually unique set of iconography that represents a specific product, organization, or group, with unique and distinctive fonts and styling. Edits which change the text of things that aren't logos (i.e. street signs, text on product packaging that doesn't edit the logo itself, BSODs, etc.) don't count, and neither do edits to logos which do not change any text.- All Sbubbies must be cleanly edited. It must resemble the original logo as close as reasonably possible. It doesn't necessarily need to be absolutely pixel-perfect, but it should hold up to a brief visual inspection at the standard zoom level.- Relevant titles: We will not be enforcing this to the degree that we did on the subreddit, but try to avoid low-effort, non-descriptive titles such as My first Sbubby, I made this, Credit to <...>, Found in the wild, or Title.- Reposts: Try not to repost images that have already been on the Sbubby Lemmy instance. We are allowing reposts from the Sbubby subreddit, but if it's not your own OC, please give credit to the original creator in either the title or a comment if at all possible. This rule will likely be relatively lightly enforced for a while, as we adjust to the new platform.- Compilations: Any compilations of edits should have some sort of connection or central theme, and preferably your own OC, but other users' content can be included as long as all of it is credited.- On that note, if you want to port over your content from the subreddit, you can create one big compilation if you'd like, but we recommend spacing out individual posts over time. It should help us maintain a consistent stream of content while we build our userbase. Don't spam a bunch of individual posts over a short period, though - probably no more than 3 posts per day.- Banned topics: Oops, all X, Bepis variants, REEEEE, loss.jpg, anything from the [banned repost album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/RT967QJs7VwLsidV7), unless you were the original creator of a banned repost album image, in which case, contact us first."
