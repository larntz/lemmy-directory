description: "## Parrots!Hello parrot lovers! This is c/parrots, a community for parrot owners and anyone that appreciate parrots.There will be some useful resources here or on a stickied post sometime in the future. ### Rules- **Don't be a jerk.** Do be helpful, kind, supportive and informative.- **No NSFW images.** This is a forum for celebrating parrots and a resource for information about parrots. It's okay to post a question about you bird's health but please don't include an image with it. If you think your bird is sick, you need to go to an avian veterinarian.- **No images of animals in unsafe situations.** This includes but is not limited to images of parrots with predators (dogs and cats), images of parrots unsecured in a moving vehicle, images of parrots outside without proper restraint or free-flight training.- Rules are subject to change in the future because I have no idea what I'm doing.### Related communities- [/c/cockatiel](https://lemmy.world/c/cockatiel): A community for cockatiel content.- [/c/backyardchickens](https://lemmy.world/c/backyardchickens@lemmy.ca): A community about backyard chickens and other birds commonly found on homesteads.- [/c/birding](https://lemmy.world/c/birding@discuss.tchncs.de): A community for those that enjoy watching wild birds in their native habitats.*Note about Moderators*If you are an original r/parrots mod, please send me a message on Reddit from your mod account with your lemmy username.
