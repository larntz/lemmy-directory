I don’t know which one to use.If you are an original r/parrots mod, please send me a message on Reddit from your mod account with your lemmy username. I have no interest in being a mod but I wanted to make sure the community title got saved. This is a community for the discussion of parrots. Feel free to talk about parrots in the wild, owning parrots, the pet trade, rescuing parrots, purchasing parrots, avian veterinarians, and anything pertaining to these beautiful creatures."
