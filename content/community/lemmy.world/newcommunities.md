description: "A place to post new communities all over Lemmy for discovery and promotion.# FormattingPlease include this following format in your post:```[link text](/c/community@instance.com)```*This provides a link that should work across instances, but in some cases it won't*You should also include either:!community@instance.comor instance.com/c/community# FAQ:*Q: Why do I get a 404?*A: At least one user in an instance needs to search for a community before it gets fetched. Searching for the community will bring it into the instance and it will fetch a few of the most recent posts without comments. If a user is subscribed to a community, then all of the future posts and interactions are now in-sync.*Q: When I try to create a post, the circle just spins forever. Why is that?*A: This is a current known issue with large communities. Sometimes it does get posted, but just continues spinning, but sometimes it doesn't get posted and continues spinning. If it doesn't actually get posted, the best thing to do is try later. However, only some people seem to be having this problem at the moment.**Image Attribution:**Fahmi, CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0>, via Wikimedia Commons"
