description: "Rule #1: Be excellent to each other.Rule #2: Keep discussion of events/users of the official Spiral Tower to a minimum. This is a public space (Lemmy does not currently have private communities) and I especially don't want gossip about Stowerlings in a public forum.This is simply a place for those Stowerlings that have jumped from Reddit to Lemmy to say 'Hi' and keep in touch."
