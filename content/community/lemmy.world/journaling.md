description: "Hello! First time in the doing anything like this, so please bear with me! There isn’t a place for people to post or talk about their journaling, which can be very helpful to others. So I decided to make one … even though I’ve never done anything remotely close to this. ————————————————————————**Welcome**This is a community for all journal related things prompts, questions, showing off, really anything relating to journaling. Always on the move, show off your everyday carry journal set up. Don’t write down paragraphs upon paragraphs of words, no worries! No matter how you journal or how you decide to keep your journal this community is for anyone who wants to share or just excited to see others set ups. ————————————————————————**Rules**— *No hateful conduct*Due to the nature of journaling posts can be very personal. Anyone who is found to be overly negative or discriminatory towards another member within this community will receive repercussions relative to the situation. Have basic etiquette, this community is based on positivity and that will remain my goal throughout. — *No spam* Spam will be considered as posting the same content more than three times.————————————————————————**Note** As this is my first time creating a community please let me know if there are any rules I should implement. I am completely open to feedback and criticism as long as it’s for the best interest of the community. "
