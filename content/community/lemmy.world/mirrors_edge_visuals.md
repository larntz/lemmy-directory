This subreddit is mainly focused on real-life environments, but Mirror's Edge inspired art and other game screenshots are allowed too.This was originally  [r/MirrorsEdgeAesthetics](https://old.reddit.com/r/MirrorsEdgeAesthetics/) but it wouldn't allow that direct name when making a community under Lemmy, so this is c/mirrors_edge_visuals"
