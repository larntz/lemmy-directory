description: "A home on LW for Android users. **RULES**While this is s community focused on Android, some of us have devices from the Android, Apple, Windows and Linux worlds, etc. We may *prefer* Android, but overzealous and obsessive **adherence to Android as some sort of infallible platform won't be tolerated long here.**That said, **being critical of brands is fine.** Android is frustrating in some ways, just like iOS and so forth. Let's be upfront about that. **Be thoughtful and helpful,** even with 'stupid' questions. Otherwise, as ya mama said, *say nothing at all.* The world won't be made better or worse by snarky dudes schooling naive newcomers on Lemmy. "
