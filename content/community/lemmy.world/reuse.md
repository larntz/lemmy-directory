By reusing, recycling or reinventing, we often manage to reduce our footprint.It must not be YOUR project, it can also be a project that you're impressed with and like from another creator, whether it be from Youtube, blogs or other sources.Rules: 1. Projects that you are planning but have no pics of yet must be marked as [planning]/[plan] in the title. 2. Every post that isn't marked as [planning]/[plan] must have at least one photo, screenshot or other pic. 3. No direct links to Reddit in posts or comments (archive links are allowed though).  4. Don't downvote posts or comments just because it doesn't appeal to your aesthetics. 5. No nudity or NSFW content.Rules are subject to change depending on the needs of this community (to prevent spam etc)."
