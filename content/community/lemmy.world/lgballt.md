description: "##### LGBT+ related drawings in the style of Polandball but on Lemmy!Original sub @ [r/lgballt](https://reddit.com/r/lgballt). Whenever at least one of the original mods are ready to take over, I'll be happy to hand them the keys.---#### RulesThese rules come directly from [the original subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/lgballt). Some rules have been edited or striked altogether due to Lemmy not having a feature related to the rule.::: spoiler 1. Don't be an asshole.> Just be nice to one another! It's not that hard. Bigotry of all forms (homophobia, transphobia, acephobia, racism, et cetera) is of course assholery, but instigating or prolonging drama is also considered assholish behaviour and will not be tolerated. Participating in a community that promotes hate may also warrant a ban.:::::: spoiler 2. Any post here must follow the three tutorials.> [The Basic Comic Creation Tutorial](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/942057196722737172/1091803462162984960/basic_tutorial.png), so all comics have a standard quality to follow.> > [Mixing Ball Guide](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/698548206392311862/702274629213093958/guide.png), so comics are not a blotted mess of color.> > The ENBI, so comics are original.> > All three can be found in the pinned post labelled [The tutorials and ENBI of lgballt](https://lemmy.world/post/433996):::::: spoiler 3. Comics must be funny.> Every comic posted on a regular day (AKA the 48 hours around Monday UTC) must, and I emphasize must, have some sort of punchline or something funny going on. If you are confused as to what that means, here is an example of a [comic with a punchline](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699767570236047451/937296426231296000/punchline.png), and an example of a [comic without one](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699767570236047451/937298489719787551/no_punchline.png).:::::: spoiler 4. Characters featured in comics must either be LGBT+ or relevant to LGBT+> Characters featured in comics must either be LGBT+ or relevant to the LGBT+ community. We also do not allow self-inserts, unless it's on the appropriate day.:::::: spoiler 5. No comics without a punchline, besides on designated days.> Comics that do not need a punchline, such as comics based on personal experiences or comics about education or self discovery can only be posted on Me Monday or within 12 hours of it, UTC time - from 12 PM UTC Sunday to 12 PM UTC Tuesday.:::::: spoiler 6. One-panel posts, low effort posts, and non-digital posts are forbidden.> Posts which consist of only one panel are not allowed. ~~If you want to post a piece of art, do it in r/lgballtart, the official art subreddit.~~ Furthermore, low effort posts (Anything hastily made with the intention of being a shitpost) and non-digital posts (For example, pictures of comics drawn on paper) are also not allowed, due to them not fitting the community.:::::: spoiler 7. No meta comics.> Meta comics (Comics detailing the state of the sub or other users) are not allowed.:::::: spoiler 8. No memes or meme templates.> Meme templates or memes are not allowed as posts in the sub. If you wanna post a meme, do it in a dedicated meme sub, ~~like /r/me_irlgbt~~. This is a comic sub, first and foremost, so any meme material will be deleted.:::::: spoiler 9. No self promotion.> No self promotion We do not allow promotion of any external services (For example, blogs, facebook pages, instagram pages, subreddits, etc.). Advertising anything here will result in a ban. We don't want this community to be used for marketing, or brigading.:::::: spoiler 10. Mark anything triggering as Spoiler and with a content warning in the title.*> As an LGBT community, we want people to feel safe while browsing, so we kindly ask everyone to mark anything that could be seen as triggering with the spoiler tags, while also leaving a warning in the title. Gore, depictions of blood and such will have to be marked as NSFW. Not following this will result on your comic being removed.:::::: spoiler 11. Tag your posts> If your post can apply to a tag, please use it. Here's an explaination of all of the tags:> > - [INFO] - Mod only; Information posts (such as The tutorials and ENBI).> - [ANNOUNCEMENT] - Mod only; Announcement posts.> - [SELF DISCOVERY] - Comics that detail a path to discovery, usually the creator's. However, comics only using the creator as an instructor are NOT self-discovery. [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgballt/comments/12woz1d/abrosexualromantic_attraction_that_is_fluid_or/)> - [EDUCATIONAL] - Comics that exist more to educate than to entertain. [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgballt/comments/12shc1k/traveling_as_lgbt_cw_bigotry/)> > If you use a mod-only tag in your post, it will be deleted with a message saying why.:::::: spoiler 12. No discourse.> No discourse or infighting. Arguing over semantics about identities such as gender, sexuality, etc is not allowed here.:::* Images cannot be spoilered AFAIK. If possible, please use text spoilers to spoiler your images. You'll probably use it for multi-image posts, anyway.#### Tags- [[INFO]](https://lemmy.world/search/q/[INFO]/type/All/sort/TopAll/listing_type/All/community_id/26743/creator_id/0/page/1)- [[ANNOUNCEMENT]](https://lemmy.world/search/q/[ANNOUNCEMENT]/type/All/sort/TopAll/listing_type/All/community_id/26743/creator_id/0/page/1)- [[SELF DISCOVERY]](https://lemmy.world/search/q/[SELF%20DISCOVERY]/type/All/sort/TopAll/listing_type/All/community_id/26743/creator_id/0/page/1)- [[EDUCATIONAL]](https://lemmy.world/search/q/[EDUCATIONAL]/type/All/sort/TopAll/listing_type/All/community_id/26743/creator_id/0/page/1)#### DiscordThe original subreddit has an official Discord server, you can find it [here](https://discord.gg/5J6dXtDBaf)."
