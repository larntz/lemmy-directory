description: "Repainting is taking an existing work of art, generally a physical painting or sculpture, and altering or adding to it.  Usually the alterations interact with the original work more than obscure it, creating a new piece with new meaning derived from a hybridization of the original artist's intent and the repainter's additions.RULES:1. Post repaintings.  Do your best to give credit to the repainter if it's not you.  Before and after pics are encouraged if available.2.  Be cool.  Constructive criticism is great, but recognize that art is often personal to the artist, and that artist is a human being.  3.  Sitewide rules apply."
