description: "# About usa user owned and open community for sharing the minimalist way of life. All types of posts are allowed, as long as they are relevant to the topic of [minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(disambiguation)). ![](https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/97849aa1-9b09-4eeb-a131-77d10cf58278.png)# Rules ::: spoiler 1. Be honest with yourself and others.The goal is to develop yourself personally and as a community.  Seriously, if you’re not honest with yourself and pretend to be someone else, you’re not going anywhere. The first step to progression is acceptance, isn’t it?:::::: spoiler 2. Be polite to others and respects each others opinions.Your freedom ends where somebody else's begins. Remember that there are people that may see things differently than you. :::::: spoiler 3. Keep it theme-oriented, up to date and relevant.In general, all types of contributions are allowed, but the relevance to this community must always be evident and presented openly by the contributor. Posts that do not meet these requirements will be removed after a public warning.:::::: spoiler 4. Use self-moderation measures first before reporting.This community is fundamentally built upon freedom of speech. Since everyone understands minimalism differently and we do not want to exclude any kind of content a priori, we appeal to the individual users to block/mute posts or users who do not meet their requirements. Please bear this in mind when filing a report:::***Other great communities:- [/c/zerowaste@lemmy.ml](/c/zerowaste@lemmy.ml) - [/c/simpleliving@lemmy.ml](/c/simpleliving@lemmy.ml)-  [/c/digitalminimalism@lemmy.ml](/c/digitalminimalism@lemmy.ml)"
