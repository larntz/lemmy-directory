description: "![](https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/6dd1caa4-ea5f-471f-a610-d567e81660be.jpeg)# AboutA community on Lemmy.world to talk about the streaming service [Dropout](https://www.dropout.tv) and all of its series:- Make Some Noise- Dimension 20- Game Changer- Um, Actually- Breaking News- Dirty Laundry- Play It By Ear- Total Forgiveness... and more!Post any content relevant to Dropout: episode discussions, fan art, questions, shiny questions, etc.# Rules**1. Be nice** Be respectful and constructive. No harassment. No grossly offensive images. No hate including racism, misogyny, transphobia, ableism, xenophobia, etc. **2. No spoilers** Don't post spoilers in the main title of a post. If posting a spoiler elsewhere, use the spoiler tag and identify which series and episode the spoiler is from. In a thread specifically about a particular episode, spoilers for that episode don't need to be tagged.**3. No pirated Dropout content** Don't link to — or request a link to — any Dropout content that is shared illegally. Transformative works like fan animations should be okay in most cases.**4. Stay on topic**All top-level posts to the community must reasonably relate to Dropout, a Dropout series, or a Dropout series cast member in some way.**5. No shitposts**Memes are fine, but noticeably low-quality content will be removed.:D"
