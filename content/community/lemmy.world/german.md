description: "**Welcome to the place to learn the German Language!** Come here to discuss topics or quirks related to  the German language, ask any questions about learning German, provide tips to current learners, and share your journey through the German-learning process!**RULES**- Make sure anything you plan on asking has not already been answered.- No harassing someone over their level of the language of German. Everyone starts somewhere.-  No harassing period actually. Obviously no bigotry falls under this category.- In general, no low effort posts or spam. If you ask a question and it didn't receive much engagement, don't go on to ask it again immediately, at the least remove the original copy.- No NSFW. This rule has its loose limits and some exceptions (i.e. commenting on German dirty talk and whatnot is alright).- Mods are the interpreters of these rules, and have jurisdiction over other cases where a rule isn't explicitly mentioned here, but it is a common sense rule. - This community is largely for English speakers learning/discussing German. Other languages aren't outright banned yet, but expect minimal support. If other communities arise for German help in other languages, then those languages will be barred from this community in favor of the new one."
