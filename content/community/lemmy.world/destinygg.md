description: "Community for Destiny the Streamer and Political Commentator. Alternative to r/destiny youtube.com/destiny twitter.com/TheOmniLiberal   Not legally affiliated with Destiny or the website destiny.gg. For now this is supposed to be a more independent fan and discussion community, but not a hater community. Extremely bad faith attacks and extremely dumb comments may still get you banned, for the sake of discussion quality. Probably more tolerant of left and right leaning commenters as long as the core community can remain a representation of good faith critical center to center left progressive views roughly representative of Destiny and his viewers. If your politics differ you may still feel welcomed as long as you keep your cool and look for exchange rather than bruteforcing your views on others. Severe Hatespeech, calls for violence, harassment, brigading not allowed.     Looking for other mods, I don't actually want to run this place. I don't even expect it to take off anyways and just set it up because why not.    I don't have a huge problem with how r/destiny is run by Destiny himself, his employees and long-term mods. This place isn't in protest to that or be a safe haven for dumbasses. "
