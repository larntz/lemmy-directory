description: "Right now just a starting point/copy of the official subreddit, because I want to get the ball rolling. Any of the mods can contact me and I'll be more than happy to give them the same roles they have on Reddit.**Rules**1) No end-of-game screenshots/MVP screensNever post an end of game screenshot to show results and performance of the match including MVP screens. If a post is up for a query that the mods deem important or necessary then discretion might be applied.2) No pro-artillery or rage postsArty clips and promotion of this mechanic as well as rage posts about it will be removed as per this update. Discussion posts will be monitored. Memes are, and always will be good.3) Read the WikiIf you have any questions please read our wiki first as it has tons of reviews/guides/FAQs that will benefit you in this game.
