description: "A community to discuss Dance Gavin Dance, their members past and present, side projects, collabs, and all things DGD related. RIP Tim Feerick.Rules:1) Keep discussion polite and respectful.2) This is a safe space for LGBTQ+3) The elephant in the room with this band may be discussed, but if the discourse turns toxic, the whole thread will be deleted.4) Self promo is allowed, encouraged even (cause who doesn't love homegrown tunes?), but be respectful and don't spam.5) WISIRO hate is punishable by death (not really, but don't be a dick about it)6) And most importantly, Don't Tell Dave."
