Poetry**  *2a:* Sharing original poetry is encouraged, but it must be preceded by the tag [OC]. *2b:* If an [OC] post is requesting feedback, it should also follow with the [FB] tag. It would look like the following example:  [OC] [FB] Nothing Gold Can Stay  **Feedback**  *All feedback should be given in good faith.**3a:* All [FB] requests should be met with comments constructive in nature. It is okay to dislike parts of a poem, but make sure to explain *why* you feel that way.  *3b:* Feedback does not need to be extraordinary in nature. Simply expressing how a work makes you feel is often enough.   *3c:* Use the honor system. When you receive good feedback, return it in kind to another author. Everyone appreciates knowing their work is being read and appreciated.*As this community develops, these guidelines may be adjusted.*---**Formatting Help**  *Work in progress*To create a line break, use two spaces at the end of a line.To create empty space, type ```&nbsp;```.Use four of these at the beginning of a line to create a standard indent.*Some mobile interfaces will show all of your markdown text in the synopsis preview, but the post will be formatted normally when clicked into.*---"
