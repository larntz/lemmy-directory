description: "![Image](https://i.imgur.com/oLugs9W.png)# **Rules****1. Follow [Code of Conduct]((https://mastodon.world/about))****2. Nothing illegal or scammy**No drugs. No deadly weapons. No sexual solicitations. No selling of used Reddit/Twitter accounts. No MLM. No crypto. We don't have to list them all, just use common sense.**3. Don't SPAM or re-post**Pretty self-explanatory. This also applies to making individual threads for each item (just lump everything into one post) or reposting the same ad every few days (delete the original before making a new one).**4. Be descriptive**Be as detailed as possible with your post. Indicate if you're a buyer or seller, where you're located, payment options, if courier only, and so on.**5. List the price when selling**Please, for the love of all that's holy: Put the price on your post. PM is not the key. Also, indicate if the price is non-negotiable to save yourself the pain of lowballers.**6. Don't troll other ads**Respect other people's ads. If you think it's too expensive, then ignore and move on.**7. No doxing**It's very easy to Photoshop IDs or pass off someone else's name and details as your own, so posting it to warn others that said person is a scammer could be putting an innocent individual in danger. This is non-negotiable.**8. Deal at your own risk**We just moderate the community and have no idea who posts here or what transactions are carried out. Deal at your own discretion and always follow your gut.![image](https://i.imgur.com/35vHsW3.png)"
