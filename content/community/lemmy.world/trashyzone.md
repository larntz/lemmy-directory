description: "You are about to enter another dimension. A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind. A terrifying journey into the depths of human depravity. Next stop, the Trashy Zone.Following these rules will increase your odds of making it out of the trashy zone alive.1. Be nice. Rude, aggressive and antagonistic commentors will be made leave. 2. I don't want a classist definition of trashy being this subs main interpretation of trashyness. Posts depicting decadent displays of wealth are encouraged 3. The five patron saints of the trashy zone are Charlie, Mac, Dennis, Dee and Frank from IASIP. Please pay homage to them whenever possible.4. No overly dark topics like sa or child abuse. I want a light tone to this place. What consistutes too dark is currently up to moderator discretion.5. Once this server hits 5k subs a community discussion post will be created. Ideas to build this community will be shared and discussed."
