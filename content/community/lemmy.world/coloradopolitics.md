description: "A place for news and discussion about politics in the Centennial State.**Rules**- Posts must be explicitly related to Coloradan politics. This includes the interaction of federal and state politics, as well as that state's congressional delegation. Local politics are permissible if they would reasonably be of interest to a statewide audience.- Title must fairly describe link contents. If your title differs from the site's, it should only be to add context or be more descriptive.- Links must be to quality and original content. Articles should be worth reading. Clickbait, stub articles, and rehosted or stolen content are not allowed.- Posts must have appropriate source flair selected from the provided list. If the source could have two flairs, select the one you think better represents the content of the post. Eg, an announcement from the Governor's office released through the Denver Post should be tagged ''Official' rather than 'News'.- Be civil.- No memes, trolling, or low-effort comments.- Vote based on comment quality, not agreement. This community aims to foster discussion; please reward people for putting effort into articulating their viewpoint, even if you disagree with it.- No hate speech, slurs, or abusive language. This will result in a ban.**Civic Links**[2023 Colorado Election Calendar](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/calendars/2023ElectionCalendar.pdf)[2023 Colorado Election Results](https://lemmy.world/post/369230)[Register to vote or update your registration online, or verify your registration](http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/vote/VoterHome.html)[Request an absentee ballot](https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot/colorado/)[Find and contact your state legislators](https://leg.colorado.gov/find-my-legislator)[Find or contact your congressional legislators](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/CO#representatives)[Contact the Governor](https://www.colorado.gov/governor/contact-us)**Local News Sources**[The Denver Post](http://www.denverpost.com/)[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)](http://gazette.com/)[The Pueblo Chieftan](http://www.chieftain.com/)[The Daily Camera (Boulder)](http://www.dailycamera.com/)[The Daily Sentinel (Grand Junction)](http://www.gjsentinel.com/)[Colorado Public Radio](http://www.cpr.org/)[The Colorado Sun](https://coloradosun.com/)**National Media Coverage of Colorado**[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/destination/colorado)[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/newssearch/?query=Colorado&utm_term=.74341acd79f1&sort=Relevance&datefilter=All%20Since%202005)[NPR](http://www.npr.org/tags/127313035/colorado)[Politico](http://www.politico.com/news/colorado)**Related Communities**[Colorado Politics on Kbin](https://kbin.social/m/ColoradoPolitics)[Colorado](https://lemmy.world/c/colorado)[Denver](https://lemmy.world/c/denver)[Colorado Springs](https://lemmy.world/c/coloradosprings)[Boulder](https://lemmy.world/c/boulder@lemmy.ml)[Fort Collins](https://lemmy.world/c/fortcollins@lemmy.ml)Pueblo[Longmont](https://lemmy.world/c/longmont@lemmy.ml)Greeley"
