description: "A place for fans of M/M stories, fan fiction, games, comics/manga/manhwa, TV and movies.Rules:1. ***Be respectful and civil. This means no insults based on sexuality, gender, race, nationality or disability. Respect other people's different preferences in fiction.***2. No fiction about real people.3. When asking for recommendations, please be specific. For example, just asking for something like (insert story here) is too vague. People won't know what specific aspect you're looking for. You can include the names of stories, shows, etc. that fit your criteria, but please specify the trope/character trait/setting you're looking for.More information about asking for recommendations:- No requests based entirely on subjective opinions, such as simply asking for good M/M romances.- No requests that entirely consist of aspects you aren't looking for.- When asking for age gap recommendations, please specify how big an age gap you mean, e.g. looking for stories where the main couple has an age gap of 10+ years."
