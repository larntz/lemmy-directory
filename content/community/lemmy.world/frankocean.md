description: "Welcome to /c/FrankOceanJust like /r/FrankOcean but with a /c/…Jokes aside, Hi I’m leaving reddit and noticed one of my fav subs was not here on Lemmy yet. Went ahead and made a community here. This is not a “land grab” im happy to moderate as well as give moderation rights to the current mods at /r/frankocean if a decision is made to move here. Feel free to post  anything you want here as long as it is related to Frank. **Rules**- Please follow the rules of Lemmy.world- Please be respectful to others here- NSFW content is allowed if it is work created by Frank, otherwise keep it clean.When i get more time I’ll come back and refine these rules. Thanks!"
