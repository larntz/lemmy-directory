description: "### Lets talk about simple beauty!Haircare, skin routines, makeup, and a little bit of health that are aimed to be on the simple side.    It can be but is not limited to;   - fewer ingredients- less intrusive and more gentle ingredients- food or non/lightly processed products- nopoo / lowpoo- ‘no makeup’ makeup- homemade products*A lot would say this is natural beauty, and I guess it is but I keep thinking there are a lot of dangerous ingredients that are natural too, like asbestos.*#### Rules- Be kind- No hate- Everyone who has an interest in the topic is welcome- Remember that what works for you might not work for others- Rules may change at any time, there will be an announcement#### Things to consider when posting- Location    It is much easier to give advice if we know what climate you are in and in what country/area you live. Tell us what type of climate you're in and what area you live in, example:    *Mild summers & cold winters, North Europe, Sweden*- Skin/hair type      Different skin and hair types need different types of products. Remember that these can change due to your overall health, season, and age.      Check out the [pinned](https://lemmy.world/post/184032) message for more info.        "
