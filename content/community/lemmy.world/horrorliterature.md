description: "A better community devoted to horror literature, where low-quality and low-effort posting is absolutely forbidden. If you only want to talk about if you like the book or hate the book, go to the other community for that. Need a recommendation? Don't ask for one here.Rules:1) No porn.2) No insulting each other. Feel free to disagree, but do it NICELY. Always remember the human behind the posts and comments.3) When discussing horror literature, say something beyond it was blah or I really liked it, cool story. Do you like a particular book or an author? Dislike? Great! Give a reason why that is beyond the typical superficial things people say online. 4) Your post should encourage discussion. If it does not, it will be removed.5) No requests for recommendations. 6) No memes. No photos. No videos."
