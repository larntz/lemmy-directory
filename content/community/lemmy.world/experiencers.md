description: "A safe space for Experiencer related discussions. Sightings, Contact, Abductions, CE5, Metaphysical, Telepathic, Channeling etc. A place for genuine supportive discussion that will not be suppressed by cynicism or aggressive skepticism.Welcome to Experiencers! This is a community for people who believe in the UAP phenomenon, including those who have had contact experiences. This is *not* a place to post discussion about whether UAP or non-human intelligence is real—the proof is out there (and in here).This is a safe space for Experiencers. **We don’t allow debunking here, even if you're polite**—we know that seems harsh, but we take the safety of our members seriously. There's enough self-doubt that comes with these experiences that we don't need other people adding more.This is the official companion community to r/Experiencers on Reddit. Please bear with us as we learn the ins and outs of Lemmy! "
