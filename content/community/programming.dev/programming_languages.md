description: "Hello!This is the current Lemmy equivalent of https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/.The content and rules are the same here as they are over there. Taken directly from the [/r/ProgrammingLanguages](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/) overview:> This community is dedicated to the theory, design and implementation of programming languages.>> Be nice to each other. Flame wars and rants are not welcomed. Please also put some effort into your post.> > This isn't the right place to ask questions such as What language should I use for X, what language should I learn, and what's your favorite language. Such questions should be posted in [/c/learn_programming](https://programming.dev/c/learn_programming) or [/c/programming](https://programming.dev/c/programming).This *is* the right place for posts like the following:- Check out this new language I've been working on!- Here's a blog post on how I implemented static type checking into this compiler- I want to write a compiler, where do I start?- How does the Java compiler work? How does it handle forward declarations/imports/targeting multiple platforms/<other tricky feature>?- How should I test my compiler? How are other compilers and interpreters like gcc, Java, and python tested?- What are the pros/cons of <language feature>?- Compare and contrast <language feature> vs. <other feature>- Confused about the semantics of this language- Proceedings from PLDI / OOPSLA / ICFP / <other large programming conference>See [/r/ProgrammingLanguages](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/) for specific examples## Related online communities- [ProgLangDesign.net](http://proglangdesign.net/)- [/r/ProgrammingLanguages Discord](https://discord.gg/4Kjt3ZE)- [Lamdda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/)- [Language Design Stack Exchange](https://languagedesign.stackexchange.com/)"
