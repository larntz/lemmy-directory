name: "ddd"
description: "Domain-Driven Design is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain. The name comes from a 2003 book by Eric Evans that describes the approach through a catalog of patterns. Since then a community of practitioners have further developed the ideas, spawning various other books and training courses. The approach is particularly suited to complex domains, where a lot of often-messy logic needs to be organized. -- Martin Fowler ([link](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html))**Rules**1. Follow Lemmy rules2.  Be excellent to each other, no hostility towards users for any reason3. No spam of tools/companies/advertisements. Itâ€™s OK to post your own stuff part of the time, but the primary use of the community should be not be self-promotion."
