Svelte focuses on reactive programming, where UI components update themselves when data changes, eliminating the need for a virtual DOM.[Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev) is an extension of Svelte that adds features like routing and server-side rendering, simplifying the creation of full-stack web applications. It provides file-based routing and supports server-side rendering, enabling faster initial page loads and improved search engine optimization. Svelte Kit combines client-side Svelte components with server-side rendering and serverless functions for a seamless development experience."
