title: "Narrowboat and UK inland waterways ( canal and river )" 
name: "narrowboat"
description: "A community for UK inland waterways enthusiasts.  While boating is our main topic. Any UK canal or river based discussion is allowed. Rules:1: Be polite. If you have nothing good to say, say nothing. I am not banning rants. Just asking folks to take a min and consider the wording. I want every waterways user to feel welcome here. We should then be able to build a resource where folks can ask for advice as they plan some event. This means walkers cyclists fishermen boaters all have help and advice to give relevent to other users. So please feel free to tell folks about an event that are things hard for you. We all enjoy joining in on the odd rant. But remember to use wording referring to the indevidual not the community they are a member of or activity they are partaking in. This way others with the same needs can learn from your needs from them while expressing their own from you.I know this sounds like I am talking to 5yo. But really I do not want this to become Facebook like. In the way groups often attack each other. 2: No SPAM or sales ads. If demand exists. We can create a boats for sale wanted community.  But please let's keep them off this community. 3: No NSFW. No one need narrowboats gonewild. Trust me you don't want me to join in so don't temp me. "
