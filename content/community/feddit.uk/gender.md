We will endeavour to moderate this community to remove extreme views of any form. That is to say, transphobia is not allowed here, but neither is blind dogmatism.You will not be banned here for an opinion, you will be for hate. We DO know the difference.Bring your research, bring your articles. Bring your viewpoints, bring your thoughts. Remember to be civil, and represent your side well. **Assume good faith**."
