description: "If you see a need for a community on Feddit.uk then the best advice is to start it. If you need help, then post a message requesting volunteers to pitch in on the moderating. Don't worry too much though there's plenty of people around who can advise the important thing is to get the ball rolling.However, if you think Feddit.uk needs a community but you aren't in a position to help it get started then this is the community for you. Start a new post with the idea and then, when someone starts it they can throw a link in.Inspired by:*  [requests@lemmit.online](https://feddit.uk/c/requests@lemmit.online)"
