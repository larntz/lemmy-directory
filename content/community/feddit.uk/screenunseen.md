description: "#Screen Unseen is an ODEON Cinema exclusive preview event of films that haven't yet been released in the UK.You book in advance and pay £5 for a ticket in standard or premier (first come, first serve so book quick!), but can't be certain what film you're about to see until the curtains go up.Showings are random and can't be said when the next one is and only open to people over 15 (although the films being shown may be any BBFC rating from U to 15). After a showing is announced, ODEON release a series of clues leading up to the night of release. These clues are often cryptic, contrived, or otherwise misleading.ODEON claim that the films they select for Screen Unseen are all guaranteed to inspire conversation.In the event that you know what the next Screen Unseen is going to be (aren't you lucky), please refrain from commenting the title of the movie so that others don't get spoiled. If we wish to comment, simply post the trailer from YouTube or something similar. **So, go converse!**---**All films shown as part of Odeon's Screen and Scream Unseen promotional screenings are listed
