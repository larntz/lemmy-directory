description: "Welcome to the Lemmygrad programming community! This is a space where programmers of all levels can discuss programming, ask for help with problems, and share their personal programming projects with others.---**Rules**1. Respect all users, regardless of their level of knowledge in programming. We're here to learn and help each other improve.2. Keep posts relevant to programming and related topics.3. Respect people's personal preferences. If you disagree with someone's choice of programming language, method of formatting code, or anything else, don't attack the poster. Genuine criticism is fine, but personal attacks are not.4. In order to promote breaks from typing, all code snippets must be photos of code written on paper.Just kidding ;), please use proper [markdown code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)."
