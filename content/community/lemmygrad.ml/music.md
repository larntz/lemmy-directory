title: "Music: Theory and Practice" 
name: "music"
description: "This is a community to engage in musical theory and practice. What exactly does that mean?- Musical theory: **how people think about music**- Musical practice: creating or listening to musicTo that end, this is simply a space for people of varying backgrounds and education to share music and their thoughts about music. Musical study via the history of music is also encouraged.Rules:1. Standard GZD rules apply here2. No elitism tolerated. The value of music is ultimately determined by how socially necessary it is, i.e. how much people **like** it and interact with it.3. By the same token, no anti-intellectualism tolerated. Like anything in the world, music is something worthy of study that everyone can always learn more about.4. No Eurocentricism tolerated. Western (specifically German) music theory and practice being considered inherently superior to the music of other cultures is reactionary."
