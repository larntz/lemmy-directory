description: "A community for everything related to Palestine and the occupation currently underway by the occupying force known as Israel.Anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism. Existence is resistance for Palestinians.Please refer to Israel as Occupied Palestine, or occupied territories. The IDF is a fascist and ethnonationalist occupying force. Israelis are settlers. We understand however that the imperial narrative (which tries to legitimise Israel) is internalised in the imperial core and slip-ups are naturally expected.We always take the sides of Palestine and Palestinians and are unapologetic about it. Israel is an occupying power whose defence force's (note the contradiction) sole purpose for existing is to push Palestinians out so they can resettle their rightful land. If you have anything positive to say about Israel we do not care."
