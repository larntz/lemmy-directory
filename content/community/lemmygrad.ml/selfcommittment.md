name: "selfcommittment"
description: "A place to be self committed, and encourage others to be as well! Make friends, give each other advice! And have fun! :)Self discipline is a negative term, so I thought self committment would be better. Helping yourself defeat bad habits, start good habits, and do things that are beneficial but hard to start shouldn't be seen as punishment. It should be seen as compassion towards yourself. So stay self committed!! :))Rules:Follow site rules and don't be a jerk! Cheers! "
