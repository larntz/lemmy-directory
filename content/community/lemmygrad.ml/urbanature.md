description: "We are often blind to all the non-human life that surrounds us in urban areas. This place is dedicated to pictures of discussion of them, be they animal, plant, or weird. Obviously only approach dangerous animals such as coyotes, felines, snakes and scorpions if you know what you're doing, and refrain from touching wildlife in general.Food chain or otherwise serious discussion is alright but please no dead animal pictures. Pets are allowed but discouraged."
