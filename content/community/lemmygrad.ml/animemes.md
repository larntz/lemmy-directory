description: "***Welcome to Lemmygrad's corner dedicated to anime memes!** ...and more! Like anime discussion! And manga memes! And donghua discussion! And manhua memes! And aeni discussion! And manhwa memes!*# Remember to Read the Rules™:1. Absolutely no racism, no transphobia, no homophobia, no ableism, no misogyny, none of that!2. No low-quality images. Images containing text should be legible.3. Please mark spoilers with the prefix [SPOILER] in the title of your post.4. Please mark NSFW content as such. This does not, however, mean you can post hentai.5. Absolutely no NSFW content containing or involving minors will be tolerated.***Please report any posts or comments that are in violation of the rules.***# Guidelines1. Try to keep it left; memes don't need to be socialist in nature, but it'd be nice if we could keep the discussions that way.2. Posts do not necessarily need to be about anime memes, they can also be about other things related to anime, or having an 'anime' art style.3. Try to provide sources for the images you post.4. There's nothing else for now. We hope you have a great time!Art by [ΛHRIMΛN (Dmitry Grozov)](https://vk.com/public.ahriman)[Banner](https://vk.com/photo-44180355_457246413?all=1) · [Icon](https://vk.com/photo-44180355_457246332?all=1)Established 2022-04-04"
