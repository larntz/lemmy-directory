title: "Pravda - Seeking Truth from Facts!" 
name: "pravda"
description: "Yes I'm aware Pravda is Russian and Seeking Truth from Facts comes from Mao.I created this community, named after the Pravda (Правда), the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to elicit conversation about current world events, from a socialist perspective. Pravda is the Russian word for “Truth”, and this community seeks to debate and discuss current news to seek truth from facts.The point of this community is to discuss current world events from a socialist perspective, whether or not the event itself inherently relates to socialism or not. If that means randomly posting headlines to facilitate discussion, so be it.Posts should not be taken as endorsement of the views of the post. This place is meant to facilitate discussion, and that sometimes requires information from sources that make incorrect conclusions.Also, feel free to post vintage pictures of the Pravda if you want."
