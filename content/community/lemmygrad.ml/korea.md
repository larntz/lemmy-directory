description: "A community about anything related to Korea, such as news about the countries (DPRK and south), discussion, photos and videos, the language, etc.See also: [!juchegang@lemmygrad.ml](/c/juchegang), which is intended for memes rather than serious discussion of these topics.The picture of this Lemmy community is magnolia (ëª©ëž€), the national flower of the DPRK. The background picture is a scenery of Pyongyang.Rules:1. No imperialist apologia. The DPRK didn't start the war. US imperialist invasion was not justified. Neither are their army bases in south Korea. The sanctions were and are not justified.2. Be respectful. The imperialist media likes to describe the DPRK people as completely brainwashed, and that it'd be fine to completely destroy that country in an invasion. Don't act like the imperialist media.3. Be skeptical of your sources. Don't trust the media that has been known to report many falsehoods about Korea already. (You may still link to them if they write something interesting / worth reading, just be careful.)"
