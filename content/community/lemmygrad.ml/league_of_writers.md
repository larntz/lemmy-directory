Patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, and any other oppressive language will not be tolerated.**No low quality or off-topic posts.** This includes almost all memes and other posts not sharing original writing, posing a question, offering analysis, or otherwise initiating discussion around literature.**No nonfiction.** An exception is made for original essays or nonfiction with creative value.**No sectarianism.** This isn't a place for infighting between tendencies.**Important Reminder:** Direct all criticism of original work towards the writing, not the writer.![](https://lemmygrad.ml/pictrs/image/db360571-50a7-4ea6-b933-ce91d1e5bcce.jpeg)"
