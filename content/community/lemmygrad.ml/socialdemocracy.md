description: "Social democracy (sometimes less politely known as social fascism) is the ideology and phenomenon that purports to find a compromise between capitalism and socialism, granting the workers some concessions while keeping the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie intact. While social democracies are indeed capable of granting some concessions, this subcommunity is focused on collecting the evidence that the masses deserve far better."
