description: "#Welcome to /c/socialism**Socialism as a political system** is defined by democratic and social control of the means of production by the workers for the good of the community rather than capitalist profit, based fundamentally on the abolition of private property relations.**Socialism is also a sociopolitical movement** dedicated to the critique and dismantling of exploitative structures, including economic, gendered, ethnic oppression.Socialism, as a movement, confronts these different systems of oppression as mutually conditioning, intersectional, and/or dialectically related within the current hegemonic order. It seeks to overcome oppression in a holistic manner without neglecting any particular axis so that it might be eliminated and genuine social emancipation may be realized. We recognize that Socialism cannot be achieved while structural oppression continues and workers are divided.We look forward to your participation in our sub, but please be mindful of our posting guidelines.
