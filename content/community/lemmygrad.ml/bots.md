description: "An informational community about Lemmygrad's non-organic comrades.If you own a bot and would like to become a mod and post something here, please message [@Arsen6331@lemmygrad.ml](https://lemmygrad.ml/u/Arsen6331), and I'll add you.Posts here should be about Lemmygrad bots. They should showcase the various features that the bot has and describe them. If your bot has a config, you can provide it here as well if you so wish.Please test the bot in the [Bot Test](https://lemmygrad.ml/c/bottest) community to make sure it's working before trying to showcase it here, in order to avoid cluttering the posts with commands that didn't work.If your bot gains a new feature, simply add a new comment to the post showcasing the feature and edit the post to include it, don't make a new post for each change. This will make it easier for people to find the capabilities of your bot as they won't have to search through multiple posts."
