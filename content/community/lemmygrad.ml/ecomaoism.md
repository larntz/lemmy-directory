name: "ecomaoism"
description: "EcoMaoism is the synthesis of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought with radical environmentalist and animal liberation ideologies. We uphold that animals are exploited and deserve the same liberations that the workers would have under communism. We are also against sources of pollution, deforestation, and climate change. We are not western liberals, We are green tankies!"
