In fact, we welcome these voices. We simply do not wish to apply the label of Pagan to those who do not apply it to themselves.Those involved in nature based spiritualities. Example: Druidry.Those involved in Wicca, Traditional Witchcraft (if they wish), and Eclectic Witchcraft (again, if they wish).Such as Anarchism, Marxism, Leninism, Mutualism, Syndicalism, Libertarian Municipalism, Democratic Socialism, Post-Leftism and other left-tendenciesMany strains of LGBTQIA+ activism, Feminism, and Liberation movements of People of Color, as well as Decolonization movements also fall into the Leftist spectrum.These hereby ideologies, amongst others that violate the general rules of use in this sub, will not be welcomed and support of them will ultimately result in a ban:FascismNationalismAnarcho-CapitalismNazbol's and Nazi'sPro-CapitalismMGTOW and MRA/ Incel-cultureEthnocentrismAmongst others at moderator discretion.No Hate Speech, Ableism, Homophobia, Transphobia, or Bigotry will be tolerated, we are not government representatives and the invocation of free-speech will not preserve you from a ban.No Proselytizing or Anti-theism, this is an expressly pagan religious space and while we are happy to share pagan experiences with those who are curious to learn, we will not take kindly to attempts to challenge our faiths.No Playing Devil's Advocate, any forms of Lesser Evilism or pandering to respectability politics will be addressed by moderation.No unapproved advertising or solicitatious posting without consent from staff.Low-effort posting, spamming and images that violate any aformentioned rules will be removed.Any and all rules are up to moderator discretion.
