description: "In North Korea, if you take a sledgehammer to a store (I thought communism was about freedom??) they put you into a facility which you are not free to leave at any time, and you have to obey rules like waking up at 8 am and going to bed at 10. They call them prisons.Yes, this is a satirical community. We here at lemmygrad support the DPRK against the unlawful government of the Republic of Korea (installed by the USA to prevent a united socialist Korea), and we support the Koreans' right to self-determination without outside interference.also I think it's funny if all posts are titled In North Korea..."
