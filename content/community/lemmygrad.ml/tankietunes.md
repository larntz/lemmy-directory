Any musicians can hang and post their own music as well! This is for everything Communist and Musical!Rules1. The music must apply to one or more of these categories: Communist Propaganda Music (Red Army Choir), Music from Socialist countries (Zemlyane, Vesyolye Rebyata, Kerber, etc) , from an anti-capitalist group supported by MLs (IRA, Syria, Libya, Etc), anti-capitalist songs and artists (real ones not grifters like Tupac, make sure of that), or music that is absent of politics entirely(shaky one here, don't toe the line) like classical or instrumentals, and remixes of the previously listed items2. You must put the Name of the song,, and artist on the title (in that order). Ex Katyusha, Red Army Choir.  - Also, if you can, put the nation the song is from (optional)-If you don't know either the artist or location, you should put unknown3. No Reactionary politics or songs4. No several hour remixes. Single songs **only**5. Only still pictures of famous artists (appreciation posts), other small exceptions apply6. Feel the vibes7. NO NIGHTCORE (unless its yours or from Samuel Farina)8. Standard Genzedong rules about conduct, any crazy business will be punished."
