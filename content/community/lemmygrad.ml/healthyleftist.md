description: "*A Far-leftist safe space for those who want a healthy lifestyle and/or a journey of becoming fit. Please have fun and make sure to meet new friends and learn from each other! :))*Rules: *Follow site rules!*- Leftists only!! Not a safe space for anyone who works with oppressive, capitalist forces, groups and communities. - No hate-speech. No justification for hate speech. No slurs, ableism, body shaming, etc. We must respect each other, and one thing that matters is acceptance, not hate.- Provide efficient, credible and helpful information. Any claim must be supported by scientific evidence and research. No false info that will harm a fellow comrade. Here's an example below of an instant ban.***Example: Recommending horse deworming pills to fight COVID-19***- Posts about history regarding health and fitness in communist countries are allowed. Such as gym classes in the soviet era.- No sectarianism. - No giving oppressors, capitalist figures, imperialist figures, and fascist credit. It doesn't matter if what they said is actually helpful, do not give them any glory. - No low quality/off-topic posts.- Fitness memes are allowed but they must not be reposted numerous times. It will be an instant ban. "
