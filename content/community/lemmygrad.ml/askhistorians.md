description: "Intended to mimic the format and style of /r/AskHistorians, while also serving as a general sub for historical discussions. The rules should be familiar for anyone accustomed to AskHistorians.1. Nothing Less Than 20 Years Old2. Don't plagiarise. Quotation of historians is acceptable and encouraged, but please cite them so that people can look at the source themselves. 3. Provide sources where applicable, and be ready to provide sources for any claim you make. Wikipedia is not a source.4. Remain on topic. Follow-up questions on the same topic are allowed and encouraged, but entirely unrelated questions should be asked in a new thread. Jokes are allowed, but please use common sense - a thread should not consist solely of comic relief!5. Don't be afraid to question established narratives, or narratives presented by other users, but refrain from conspiracy theories or pseudo-history. If you want to discuss Nazi Antarctic bases, credible sources are expected.6. Speculation and presentation of original ideas is allowed and encouraged, but do NOT attempt to pass it off as undisputed fact. Make it clear that this is your own thought/opinion.7. Debate is allowed, provided that it remains structured, civil, and on-topic. A thread about the Kronstadt Rebellion is welcome to contain debate on that topic, but the debate should not become a general debate between Marxism and Anarchism as ideologies. Debate in a comradely fashion. Personal attacks won't be tolerated."
