To avoid possible misunderstandings, all responses will quote PL.***At a glance**PL is an international Marxist-Leninist party, “active in 27 countries”[[1]](https://www.plp.org/challenge/2015/9/3/pls-50-year-convention-onward-to-a-lifetime-of-revolution.html), which in the “fall of 1961” “convened a small collective that would soon leave the CPUSA”[[2]](https://www.plp.org/challenge/2011/7/21/comrade-milt-rosen-1926-2011-founding-chairperson-of-plp-gre.html). “Our [PL’s] policies are based squarely on Marxism-Leninism.”[[3]](https://www.plp.org/display/Search?searchQuery=One+Class%3A+One+Party+(1987)) According to PL, Trotskyism is “the vanguard of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie”[[4]](https://www.plp.org/display/Search?searchQuery=Trotsky%3A+Just+Another+Right-Winger), “On the [right](https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=DD5F59332E3CB6230D0437831F145C71) stand the Khrushchevs, the Brezhnevs and the Gorbachevs”[[5]](https://www.plp.org/display/Search?searchQuery=Stalin%27s+Successes%2C+Humanity%27s+Gains), Gonzalo-type Maoism “endlessly quot[es] Mao's words, while consistently opposing their meaning”[[6]](https://www.plp.org/display/Search?searchQuery=Peru's+Tarnished+Path), and the GPCR Left’s “failure to break with Maoism, ideologically and organizationally, led to their defeat”[[7]](https://www.plp.org/display/Search?searchQuery=%22The+GPCR+%26+The+Reversal+Of+Workers%27+Power+In+China+%281971%29%22) while the GPCR has been “the period of China’s history most attacked and slandered by the capitalists who now rule China.”[[8]](https://www.plp.org/challenge/2016/12/9/workers-commemorate-the-great-proletarian-cultural-revolutio.html) PL was referring to the “restoration of Russian capitalism”[[9]](https://www.plp.org/display/Search?searchQuery=Criticism+and+Self-Criticism%3A+Deepening+Roots) by 1966 and characterizes the GPCR as “the first revolution in history to attempt to take power back from the fake ‘communists,’ known as revisionists”[[10]](https://www.plp.org/challenge/2016/12/9/the-cultural-revolution-historic-uprising-for-workers-power.html) while [t]he defeat of the GPCR and the reversal of the Chinese revolution signaled the end of the old communist movement. These setbacks plunged the international working class into the Dark Night.[[11]](http://www.plp.org/challenge/2014/4/26/cultural-revolution-collectivity-uplifts-the-individual.html)But how does this fit with [Vietnam](http://www.plp.org/display/Search?searchQuery=Vietnam%3A+Defeat+U.S.+Imperialism) receiving military aid from the the USSR or any number of other scenarios?
