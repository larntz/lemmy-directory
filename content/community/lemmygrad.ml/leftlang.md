description: "A place to discuss linguistics with or without Marxist context, this includes discussion of  Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics.  Rules:No oppressive language-No using slurs for any oppressed group. They (them/theirs) is (are) a perfectly fine gender neutral pronoun(s) of which is not always plural.No reactionary political opinions-This applies to all Lemmygrad communities and it applies here. Euro-centrism-European languages are completely fine here though try not to in anyway point to non-European languages as odd or foreign. As well don't push colonial theories about language.Last point: all those who speak out against the voiceless uvular plosive will be sent the gulag.(keep in mind you may be banned for other inappropriate behavior not listed in the rules)(read this: https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1950/jun/20.htm)"
