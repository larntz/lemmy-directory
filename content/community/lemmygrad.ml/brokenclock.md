title: "Broken clock moments" 
name: "brokenclock"
description: "A community for posting instances when liberals or reactionaries say something not-so-stupid every once in a blue moon.Rules:- All posts must feature some kind of progressive anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, or anti-western sentiments coming from enemies of Marxist-Leninists, mainly liberals, conservatives, and social democrats.- Don't post anything by completely mask-off/open fascists, no matter how leftist it sounds. An exception might be made if the broken clock moment is known, **without a doubt** to have occurred before said person became a fascist. PatSocs, MAGACommunists, and the like also fall under this category.- Ultra-leftists are by definition anti-capitalist and—depending on the tendency—anti-imperialist so posting progressive statements by these groups is neither noteworthy nor suitable for this community. This rule does not apply to liberals who think they are ultras when they are not unless the broken clock moment is a grift, such as happening during a livestream with donations."
