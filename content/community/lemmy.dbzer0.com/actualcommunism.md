description: "An international (English speaking) communist lemmy community free of the ML influence of instances like lemmy.ml and lemmygrad. This is a place for undogmatic and constructive discussion of current events from a communist/marxist perspective, regardless of specific current (as long as it is progressive, anti-capitalist and truly anti-imperialist). A certain knowledge of theory is expected, if you are new to/interested in communist ideas, please visit [c/Communism101](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/actualcommunism101) (still under construction) before participating here. Communism101 will gladly help you by answering questions, providing resources etc. Memes go in [c/Commie Memes](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/commiememes)**Rules****1. No Infighting**Try to keep an open mind, other schools of thought may offer points of view and analyses you haven't considered yet. Critiques of other currents, as well as anarchism, are welcome as long as they stay constructive and civil.**2. Anti-Imperialism means recognizing capitalist states like Russia and China as such**,as well as condemning (their) imperialism, even if is of the anti-USA flavor.**3. No liberalism, (right-wing) revisionism or reactionaries.**That includes so called: Social Democracy, Democratic Socialism, Dengism, Market Socialism, Patriotic Socialism, National Bolshevism, Anarcho-Capitalism etc. Anti-Communist people and content have no place here, as well as the variety of Marxist-Leninists seen on lemmygrad (actual ML's are welcome as long as they agree to the rules and don't just copy paste/larp about stuff from a hundred years ago).**4. No Bigotry.**The only dangerous minority is the rich.**4. Don't demonize previous and current socialist experiments or (leading) individuals.**We must constructively learn from their mistakes, while acknowledging their achievements and recognizing when they have strayed away from socialist principles.**5. Don't idolize/glorify previous and current socialist experiments or (leading) individuals.**Notable achievements in all spheres of society were made by various socialist/people's/democratic republics around the world. Mistakes, however, were made as well: bureaucratic castes of parasitic elites - as well as reactionary cults of personality - were established, many things were mismanaged and prejudice and bigotry sometimes replaced internationalism and progressiveness."
