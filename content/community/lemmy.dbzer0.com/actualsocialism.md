description: "A international (English speaking) socialist lemmy community free of the ML influence of instances like lemmy.ml and lemmygrad. This is a place for undogmatic and constructive discussion of current events from a progressive, anti-capitalist and truly anti-imperialist perspective, regardless of specific ideology. A certain knowledge of socialism is expected, if you are new to/interested in socialism, please visit [c/Socialism101](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/actualsocialism101) (still under construction) before participating here. Socialism101 will gladly help you by answering questions, providing resources etc.**Rules**1. Socialist Unity in the form of mutual respect and good faith discussion is enforced here. Try to keep an open mind, other schools of thought may offer points of view and analyses you haven't considered yet. Also: This is not a place for the Idealism vs. Materialism or rather Marxism vs. Anarchism debate(s), for that please visit [c/AnarchismVsMarxism](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/anarchismvsmarxism) (still under construction)2. Anti-Imperialism means recognizing capitalist states like Russia and China as such and condemning (their) imperialism, even if is of the anti-USA flavor.3. No liberalism, (right-wing) revisionism or reactionaries. That includes so called: Social Democracy, Democratic Socialism, Patriotic Socialism, Dengism, National Bolshevism etc. Anti-Socialist people and content have no place here, as well as the variety of Marxist-Leninists seen on lemmygrad (actual ML's are welcome as long as they agree with the rules and don't just copy paste/larp about stuff from a hundred years ago).4. No Bigotry. The only dangerous minority is the rich.4. Don't demonize previous and current socialist experiments or (leading) individuals. We must constructively learn from their mistakes while acknowledging their achievements and recognizing when they have strayed away from socialist principles.5. Don't idolize/glorify previous and current socialist experiments or (leading) individuals. Notable achievements were made by various socialist republics around the world. Mistakes however, were made as well: bureaucratic castes of parasitic elites, as well as reactionary cults of personality, were established. As well as major cases of mismanagement and outright reactionary measures that are not up for debate in terms of them taking pace, the nature of the events however, is. To name a few: (re)criminalization of homosexuality, crushing of workers revolts (1953, 1956, 1968), deportation and discrimination based on ethnicity (Volga-Germans, Jews)"
