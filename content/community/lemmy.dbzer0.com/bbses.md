description: "The place to discuss Retro Communities like BBS, Fido-Net, Metrolink, Doors games and old forums/technology and even ANSI art. “Retro Communities” is not just about old technologies, it’s also about the “feel” of those older communities. Text walls are allowed, asking questions is encouraged. Making a mistake is not a tragedy. You are welcome here!
