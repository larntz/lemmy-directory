If creating a game download thread, please include the title gameID and Dump Tool Version. 2. Be civil. 3. Piracy is bad, we advocate only backing up games which are already owned by you, the user. 4. The gerenal rules of reddit apply here but are not limited to; no doxxing, no threatening violence, etc. These actions will be met with an immediate ban 5. No selling links to game downloads. No asking people to pay for you to download and dump a game. No monetization links such as adfly or other revenue generating links. This will get you banned. 6. Direct links to downloads located on private servers (anything but a public file host) require mod approval. This includes sites which require a login and or password. 7. Links that require a password, have click thru links or that require a special account to access require mod approval. These would include Password ZIP files, Baidu links and linking to a secondary site that uses any of the previously mentioned features. Failure to get approval will get the links removed and you may lose posting privileges. 8. If you ask a question that is answered in the EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW thread, it will get be deleted. Repeated infractions may result in a ban. 9. Requests should be directed to the appropriate thread above. All low level requests (can someone dump, can I have this save) will be removed if not posted to the Megathreads. 10. Please try to keep posts Vita related please. There's no reason to be posting about 3DS or PS4 (unless it's somehow related to the Vita). 11. English only please."
