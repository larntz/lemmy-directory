title: "A place to discuss true freedom, true emancipation, true sovereignty of the individual" 
name: "sovereignty"
description: "Freedom is nice; sovereignty is better.Thankfully we live in a time when the tools exist to enable the individual to grant sovereignty to himself (or herself).This is a community for philosophical discussion on what sovereignty means for the individual. What role do weapons play in the life of a person? What role does encryption play in the life of a person? Where do rights come from? What is a privilege? Does the state have a place in the future?What will get you kicked or banned:Bigotry to another person (but you can discuss social phenomena relating to bigotry or groups regarded by some as oppressed, but no actual bigotry will be tolerated),Things that are against the law in the US (I would love to allow it, but some things can get people locked in a cage or worse),We welcome questions."
