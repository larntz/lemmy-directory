description: "Repurposed from Reddit's /r/Thatsabooklight Sub:Props Must Be Repurposed*: All props must be repurposed in some way. An airplane belt used as a belt for pants is okay. An unmodified lamp used as a lamp is not okay. We will allow exceptions to this rule only on 'Found A Prop' FridaysBe Excellent To Each Other: This rule ranges from hate speech and bigotry to off-topic slapfights, spam, and derailments. Be excellent to each other. Remember that there's a human there you're interacting with. Remember that breaches of this rule will be handled at mod discretion. And remember... to party on dudes!! #WYLDSTALLYNSTry To Avoid Reposts: Reposts are at least kind of bogus, right? I mean, some people may not have seen them before, if it's been awhile since it was posted, but recently? That's not cool, man. That's piggybacking. That's kind of a jerk move. Don't do it.No Trolling and No Spam: Trolling is bogus, too, dudes. It's even worse than reposting. And spam? Copypasta? Tired and repetitive me too thanks nonsense? Really? Yeah, no, none of that here. No baiting, no trolling, no spamming, no nonsense. Got it? Good.Format Your Title Correctly!: Please specify first whether your prop is from [Film], [TV], or [Other]. Then if you would please give the title and year of the work, followed by a detailed description of the prop and what it is being used as in the screenshot (in either order)."
