We do NOT blindly bash Microsoft without anything behind. We work on facts not on bad faith. ---\t::: spoiler Community Rules- Stay on the topic or considering opening your own thread.- No trolling, keep emotional outbursts to yourself.- Absolute no hate allowed. Discuss things on a civil manner or let it go.- Fanboys and disrespectful people are not welcome.
