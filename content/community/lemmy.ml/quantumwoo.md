description: "A fun community for discussing ideas such as:Do electrons have consciousness?Does the universe exist if we're not looking at it?Many Worlds Theory, Teleportation, Simulation Theory, etc.If a sentence has the word quantum in it, and if it is coming out of a non-physicist's mouth, you can almost be certain that there's a huge quantum of BS being dumped on your head.  - Physicist Devashish Singh, quoting a colleague [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Quantum_woo]()"
