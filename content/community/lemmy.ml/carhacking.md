description: "Car Hacking - The ECU and protocols like CANbus have become the heart and brain of most modern cars, but it has also become a locked down black box. This is a place for people interested in taking back control of the car they bought. New age hot rodders, ECOmodders, Security researchers, the curious, the paranoid, and the tinkerers are all welcome. We encourage the use of open source solutions and tools like arduino and rasberry pi.**Purpose:**&nbsp;While the engine is the heart of the car, the ECU has become the ever-evolving, all-knowing brain. However, this brain is a closed, locked-down black box. This is a place for people interested in taking back control of the car they own or keeping others out. New age hot rodders, ECO modders, security researchers, the curious, the paranoid, and the tinkerer are all welcome. Discussion is not limited to the ECU, post any hacked DIY Aero, powertrain, suspension, or other car topics the community might like. &nbsp;**Goals:**The car hacking community is alive but fractured and decentralized, let's start by aggregating all of the many projects, and hackers.  We would also like to encourage the use of Open source hardware and software. Our long term goal is to become the most technical car subreddit. &nbsp;Mod note: Most of my time is taken up building hardware, if a better person for the community comes along I would be willing to hand over the sub. We could also use help with our documentation.&nbsp;-------------------------------------------------------------------------**[Getting started](https://archive.is/zCA5R)****[Resources](https://archive.is/CrQ3A)****[Related Sub Reddits](https://archive.is/uph2o)****[Tools](https://archive.is/D5YcZ)****[Technical Forums](https://archive.is/YvZyS)****[Advocates](https://archive.is/KEFlv)****[Other social media](https://archive.is/HwGjq)**Originally  [r/CarHacking](https://old.reddit.com/r/CarHacking/)Flairs:CAN LIN SWCAN J1850 PWM J1850 VPW ISO 9141 KWP 2000 Multiple No Protocol"
