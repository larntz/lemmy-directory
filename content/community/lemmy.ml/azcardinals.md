description: "A non-Reddit alternative to /r/azcardinals. It will likely be slow for a while, also I have been on Lemmy for a total of 3 days. Hopefully, this works out. Eventually, I will figure out the banner and sidebar situation if this gains any traction.   Rules:  1) Don't be a dick  2) No Spam  3) Common sense and Lemmy rules apply.   4) Fuck the Steelers."
