description: "Sub for any gaming related content!Rules:- **1: No spam or advertising.** This basically means no linking to your own content on blogs, YouTube, Twitch, etc.- **2: No bigotry or gatekeeping.** This should be obvious, but neither of those things will be tolerated. This goes for linked content too; if the site has some heavy anti-woke energy, you probably shouldn't be posting it here.- **3: No untagged game spoilers.** If the game was recently released or not released at all yet, use the NSFW tag and avoid typing spoilers in the title."
