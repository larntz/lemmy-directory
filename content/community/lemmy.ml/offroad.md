description: "A lemmy community for offroad enthusiastsRules:1. Let's be nice. Let's especially avoid the brand-bashing. For example, let's avoid 4x4s vs. adventure bike, Ford vs. Chevy type discussions.2. Please don't use this community as a place to sell whatever new off-road product your company makes. Instead, please use this community as a place to share your off-road experiences, ideas, knowledge, plans, etc."
