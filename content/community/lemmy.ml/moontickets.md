description: "Get your tickets now!This is a community for GME, AMC, and BBBY apes.  We strive to be as open and democratic as possible while sticking to the purpose of this community.DD, memes, opinions, and general discussion on these stocks are welcome.  Please keep all other topics, especially divisive ones, to their respective communities.Rules are simple:* **Be nice**.  Remember there is another human on the other side of the screen.  No harassment, threatining, bullying, etc.  * **Bring sources**.  Trust me bro is fun, but let's try and backup our claims to combat rampant FUD.* **No organizing/market manipulation**.  This should be an obvious illegal no-no.* **No crypto**.  For the time being, we will not allow specific crypto discussion.  Talk of crypto as it relates to certain stocks is fine.As the community grows, we can modify the rules as needed.  This community also reserves the right to add other heavily manipulated and shorted stocks to the discussion or remove stocks from discussion as the community sees fit.And remember that nothing here is financial advice!"
