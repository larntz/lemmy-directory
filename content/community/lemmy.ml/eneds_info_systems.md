description: "This is going to be the chronicle of one person trying to become technologically literate. This is basically a vanity thing. I'm going to update regularly with short tutorials for things that are common sense or common knowledge for most people. If you get offended by a guide to opening a command prompt, this is not the place for you.Feel free to post your own tutorials and resources, but please make sure they are free of any unnecessary barriers. Things like jargon and skipping over obvious things, dangers, and cautions.Rules1. Understand I am doing my best. 2. Don't be a fake expert. I'm tired of trying to learn from fake experts. 3. Use accessible language.4. Feel free to correct anything or add cautions. 5. Don't make anyone feel stupid for not knowing something technical. Understand they have gone their whole lives without needing this knowledge and you are not better than them for having obtained it first. 6. This is a place for complete honesty in learning. Knowledge hoarding or grandiosity will be called out liberally. If you cannot gear your post towards beginners or start a series of labeled posts that develop skills from the beginning, post in one of the numerous other communities. "
