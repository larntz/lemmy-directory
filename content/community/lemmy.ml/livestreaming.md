If you would like to take over this community, just message me here or at misnina@crystals.rest]A community about everything livestreaming! Questions, advice, warnings, news, and maybe *a sprinkle* of self-promotion.All are welcome of any platform, regardless of FOSS or not.###  Open Source Streaming Site Software- [Peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/)- [Owncast](https://owncast.online/)### Open Source Broadcasting Software- [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/)### Rules- Be respectful, and do not harshly judge other's preferences or ideologies for streaming. You can still disagree, but be civil about it.- No hate speech, bigotry, etc- Self-promotions should be contained within periodic plugin posts for all. It's not against the rules to link to your socials if it feels pertinent to the conversation or to provide examples.- No direct links to NSFW content, but it is allowed to talk about the accounts in general. Yes, this means talking about sex worker streams is acceptable.- Only post drama if related to streaming as a whole. ******- Memes are allowed.****** *Two streamers getting into a personal beef with each other is not related to the platform of streaming as a whole. A ban or terrible action of a streamer might be related, if for example, it set a possibly bad precedent for that platform as a whole, or would cause worrying moderation attitudes.*"
