description: "## About[Thumb-Key](https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key) is a _privacy-conscious_ smart keyboard, made specifically for your thumbs.It features a **3x3 grid layout**, as many older phones had, and uses swipes for the less common letters. Initial testing shows that you can reach ~25 words per minute after a day of use.Instead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses **large keys with predictable positions**, to prevent your eyes from [hunting and pecking](https://www.keyboardingonline.com/hunting-and-pecking/) for letters.As the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of [touch-typing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.This project is a follow-up to the now unmaintained (and closed-source) [MessageEase Keyboard](https://www.exideas.com/ME/), which is its main inspiration."
