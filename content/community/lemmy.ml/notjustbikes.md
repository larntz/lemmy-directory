description: "**NOTE**: Unofficial lemmy community.A Lemmy community for Not Just Bikes, a video series about life in Amsterdam, and why Dutch cities are so great. It's not just bikes.Rules: 1. **Be Nice.** It's the internet, but be nice. And report trolls & spammers. 2. **No memes.** No memes, image macros, or low-effort posts. These are easily upvoted, but they pollute the subreddit very quickly. POSTING MEMES WILL RESULT IN A TEMPORARY BAN. 3. **Stay on topic.** Try to stick to posts and comments related to the themes of NJB videos, or content creation. Things like urban planning, mobility & transportation, social equity, Dutch culture, etc.. 4. **No trolling** Go troll somewhere else. We don't need that shit here. 5. **No comment screenshots** We have no patience for advocates of vehicular cycling. You can talk about vehicular cycling, but if you promote it as an alternative to safe bike infrastructure, we will ban you. You can post that crap somewhere else. 6. **No people being hit by cars / road violence** Do not show videos or pictures of people being hit by cars, or other road violence. We don't need to see that shit. We know cars are dangerous, and many people have bad memories of car crashes. Keep it out of this subreddit. 7. **No tone policing** We don't need any more tone police. If you don't like the tone that Not Just Bike takes in his videos, there's a very easy solution: stop watching them. 8. **No Internet drama** Don't spread or promote drama over what has happened on the Internet. You're spending too much time online: go touch grass."
