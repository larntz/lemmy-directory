description: "Welcome, EDM enjoyers!This community was created to share and discuss songs and artists you enjoy listening to.Please add the release year between brackets at the end of songs so others know if it's a new release or a throwback.Example: Au5 - Serenata feat. Keeley (2015).Genres are fluid so mandating a genre tag will not be useful. If you think a song can be clearly classified within an existing genre then you can add a tag between square brackets after the year.Example: Last Heroes - Naked Soul feat. Liel Kolet (2020) [Melodic Dubstep].You're always free to hit me (@Amir@lemmy.ml) up if you have something good or want some personalized suggestions. My favourite genre is Orchestral Melodic Dubstep but I listen to anything with a thick bassline and soaring chords."
