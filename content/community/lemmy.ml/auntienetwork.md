No links to funding sources are allowed (ie CashApp, Venmo, gofundme, etc.)AUNTIES/HELPERS ARE STRICTLY ADVISED NEVER TO SEND CASH DIRECTLY TO ANYONE.

This sub advises that you never send cash/prepaid cards/checks or money in any form.3. No cross posting or sharing information4. No disruptive behaviorDisruptive behavior - argumentativeness, quotations of religious texts, or any other behavior found to be in contempt of the intent of this sub will result in at least a warning if not an immediate ban. This is at the mods’ discretion.Additionally, we request that you avoid curse words -- not that we like or approve of censorship, but we've found that this language tends to incite and inflame, which is not what this sub is for. No flame wars here.5. No requesting or giving medical adviceDO NOT request medical help. We cannot advise about any medical information. We care about your health and that is precisely why we ask that you please see a doctor. If it is an emergency, go to urgent care or the emergency room. This includes banning the sharing of “recipes” for homemade abortives which are potentially very unsafe.Absolutely no prescription medications may be shared through this sub. If you need prescription medication, please use proper channels to acquire it.6. Press RequestsWe do not allow press requests to be posted to our sub looking for stories. As stated in our rules, privacy is of the essence, and we don't want our members feeling that their stories are being farmed for use by the press."
