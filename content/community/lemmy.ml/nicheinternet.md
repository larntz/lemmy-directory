We can live those days again....Filed under Humor/Memes but it doesn't *have* to be funny. note from kixiQu: I post a good amount of things from [href.cool](https://href.cool) and [marijn's linkroll](https://marijnflorence.neocities.org/linkroll/) into this sub because I think they have a lot of fabulous examples. if anyone gets tired of it, DM me.
