description: "People are crafty - one of the most astonishing traits of human beings and in this community we celebrate it. Arts and craft, software or consumer products - really anything you or a *small team* have brought into this world, something you are proud of. A bucket community for your haiku and elaborate bullet journal page - your drum solo and your custom bitmap font.The point is *to not have different silos* for everything we share. Hopefully, as a result of this community our works and passions will reach unexpected audiences, commentary and spread. It might also serve as a taste breaker in your feed.Rules:1. Be supportive, constructive or silent.2. You are in fact the main architect of the thing.3. Don't spam your thing, only one post per thing. If it is a series of things that fit together as one - try to consolidate them into one post.4. Do provide a description attached to your post.OK. a couple of points which we should probably iron out:- What is a *small team*?- Should there be a line drawn for commercial interests?"
