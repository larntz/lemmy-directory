description: "A place to share pictures  # Rules  #### 1. Images only (obviously).  But meta posts without images are allowed.  #### 2. Pictures only  This community is for pictures. Merriam-Webster defines a picture as “a painting, drawing, or photograph of someone or something.” However, this community will extend this definition. Digital forms such as 3D render are allowed. Abstract art forms that do not represent anything are also allowed.  #### 3. No distracting superimposed text or emoji  Generally, you should be able to appreciate a post without being able to read.  #### 4. No low quality MS paint-esque drawings  #### 5. Remember to follow lemmy.ml sitewide rules  You can find them on the sidebar of the homepage"
