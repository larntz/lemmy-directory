A whole-food plant-based, low-fat diet could reverse heart disease and diabetes.This community is slightly different to our friends at [c/vegan](vegan). Here our focus is on diet (rather than animal welfare), and our motivations for eating plant based may include environment or health (though we're all for animal welfare too).**A whole food plant based diet includes:**- vegetables (leafy green vegetables, root vegetables, red, green, purple, orange, and yellow)- legumes (beans, peas, and lentils of all varieties)- mushrooms- whole grains and whole grain products, such as bread and pasta- fruit- seeds and nuts (except where they have been processed into high fat products, such as with coconut cream or milk).**These are not included in a WFPB diet:**- meat, poultry, eggs or fish- dairy products (milk, cheese, yoghurt, *et cetera*)-  added/refined oils- juice with the fibre or pulp removed**Importantly...**- Make sure you get the vitamins and nutrients you need, through a variety of foods- Use a B12 sipplumunt or eat B12 fortified food (B12 is not naturally found in plants)- **Talk to your doctor or nutritionist before making decisions that will affect your health.****You may also be interested in**- [c/vegan](vegan)- [c/veganrecipes](veganrecipes)- [c/plantbasedrecipes](plantbasedrecipes)Icon: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@thoughtcatalog?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText>Thought Catalog</a> on <a href=https://unsplash.com/s/photos/fruit-vegetables?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText>Unsplash</a>Banner: Photo by <a href=https://unsplash.com/@peterwendt?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText>Peter Wendt</a> on <a href=https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText>Unsplash</a>"
