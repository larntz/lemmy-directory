description: "This is a community to share quality sources to support claims and keep them all in a single place. You know that CIA report admitting ...? Historical documents proving ...? Video evidence of ...? Make it available here!Rules:1. Every post must contain at least one source, preferably a link, and possibly accompanied by images or explanations. A text quote with no context or way to check its authenticity is not a valid source!2. Posts should make clear what information the source(s) provide(s), preferably just from reading the title or alternatively in the description.3. Be rigurous about facts. Person x stated that ... happened is not the same as ... happened, and that should be made clear in the post.4. Please note that no specific political ideology is enforced here, but truth is. Fabricated evidence (if proven to be such) will be removed."
