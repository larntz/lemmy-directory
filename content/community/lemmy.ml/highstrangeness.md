description: "Exploring oddities, UFOs, the paranormal, fringe science, cryptids, and anomalies in consciousness, existence, and personal experience. Both skeptics and believers are welcome for honest conversation about all that is strange. Belligerent fighting, racism, name calling, marginalization, trolling, political derision, and mean-spirited interactions are not. This community is a safe, open space for sharing and appreciating all that is strange and inexplicable. Mothman is our mascot. J. Allen Hynek is our president. Indrid Cold is watching."
