You may elaborate in the post body.- If OP gives a list of options and says so in the post body, do not make top-level comments different from those options.- Top-level comments must be short and single option. You may give a brief objective explanation of your option. Do not post your opinions.- Do not repeat answers. Use the up and down vote buttons. Vote as many answers as you want.- Do not post loaded questions or push agendas.- Do not repost polls in less than a month.- Follow the Lemmy Rules."
