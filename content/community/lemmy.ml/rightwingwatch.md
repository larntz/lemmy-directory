description: "The topic of the community: **Right wingers planning something**.An example would be if like trump announces he's going to run for president. Or a deportation movement picking up steam (which insinuates more upcoming deportations)Don't post links to sign up pages or anything like that, otherwise right wingers might eventually start watching this community to discover and recruit.A good format is to expect the reader to be silly and to explain how this rightwing activity will affect the bigger picture. Ex if trump becomes president there will likely be more deportations."
