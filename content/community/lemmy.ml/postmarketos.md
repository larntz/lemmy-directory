description: "Please do not ask here if we could port your device. We won't go and buy your device just to do the port. But you can try [porting yourself](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Porting_to_a_new_device), it is not that hard and we will help you wherever you get stuck in the [chat](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Matrix_and_IRC). If that is not an option for you, consider sending a device to a community member who agrees to do the porting for you (check the [milestones](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Milestones)) or simply add it to the [wish list](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Device_Wishlist)."
