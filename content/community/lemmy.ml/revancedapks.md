description: "Sub for pre-compiled APKs of the latest versions of Youtube ReVanced. Request for authorised posters are actively encouraged as long as you do not provide malicious APKs and adhere to the format.The original patches and integrations on the official Youtube APK (which I download from APKMirror), are from the repos (revanced-patches & revanced-integrations) linked here https://github.com/revanced but I use the modified version by inotia00 who offers some more customisations while compiling, the source code of which are available on the repos linked on their Github profile. ONLY the Github repos, and any websites linked there are official, trust NOTHING else if you're looking to compile yourself.Subreddit at r/myrevancedapks"
