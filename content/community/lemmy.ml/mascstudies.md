title: "Masculinity Studies" 
name: "mascstudies"
description: "A group for sharing information on masculinity as a social construct, particularly in its historical development, various social formations, process of change, and intersections with other identities. Some minimal feminist framework is presupposed. This is **not** an MRA group, so *do not* expect this to be a sympathetic space if you are of that ilk.Some base rules:- Prior to simply dismissing personal experiences, try to account for them or at the very least account for their recounting- No ad-homs, motte-and-bailey, or goalpost shifting when arguing ensues- Claims controversial among experts or not common knowledge should be sourced- Personal accusations on the basis of mere offense should be channeled into critiques of behavior and implication instead, unless its regarding the breach of these rules"
