name: "anti_consumerism"
description: "anti_consumerism is a community for discussing and critiquing the consumerist society we live in. The community uses an anti-capitalist lens to reflect on our own patterns of perpetuating capitalist values in our own lives and discuss alternatives. Kill the capitalist in your head.**Rules**- Strict adherence to Lemmy.ml's CoC.- No debating or concern trolling capitalist arguments. There are other places you can do that. Our discussion starts with a presumption that capitalism is inherently unethical.- Cryptocurrencies are not anti-capitalist alternatives to consumerism.- No holier than thou attitudes. We can't judge others needs/ability to survive the material reality of capitalism. Inspiring someone to consume less is more important than shaming some dude's Funko Pop collection.**Ideas for Content**- Articles and essays critiquing consumerism.- Instructions to repair or DIY goods instead of buying them.- Alternatives to consumerism (gift economies, mutual aid, libraries, sharing, etc)- Self reflection on consumerist habits and personal growth in moving away from consumerism.- Propaganda and memes that inspire people to consume less.[]()"
