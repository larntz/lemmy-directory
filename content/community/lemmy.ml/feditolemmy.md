description: "We like to describe the Fediverse as this wonderful place where you can sign up on a microoblogging server and seemlessly interact with content from link aggreators and video platforms. The truth is that this Fediverse is still a work in progress. This is a place where users can play around from various fedi platforms to witness some of this progress.The intended way is to:- try publishing various forms of top level posts - link the posts who do not make it through to `lemmy.ml` on a [dedicated pinned post](https://lemmy.ml/post/241797)- try publishing various forms of  comments on a [dedicated pinned post](https://lemmy.ml/post/241819)- comment the aforementioned tests to give feedback about how it comes through to youThis community does not have its own set of rules, and is rather submitted to the `lemmy.ml` instance's rules.The icon was realised from - [the fediverse logo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fediverse_logo_proposal.svg) : Eukombos, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons- [the Lemmy UI favicon](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui/blob/main/src/assets/icons/favicon.svg)"
