description: "Welcome to the lemmy branch of TRoER. This functions as an addition, not a replacement, to the discord server, and will serve a different purpose. The aim of this branch is to provide a high [signal-to-noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) ratio content feed.Tags (place before title in square brackets):- [IDEA]- [MUSIC]- [NEWS]- [NOTICE]- [GAME]If content does not fit into one of the above tags, do not post it. Shitposting is not tolerated (unless it's really funny), and neither is 'useless' content. Please bear in mind the goal of this channel - a high SNR. Contact an admin to add a tag you think would fit."
