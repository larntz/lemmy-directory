description: "[Are you an Anarchist? The answer might surprise you!](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-are-you-an-anarchist-the-answer-may-surprise-you)Rules:1. Be respectful2. Don't be a nazi3. Argue about the point and not the person4. This is not the place to debate the merits of anarchism itself. While discussion is encouraged, getting in your “epic dunks on the anarkiddies” is not. As a result of the instance’s poor moderation policies and hostility toward anarchists by default, lemmygrad users are encouraged not to post here, though not explicitly disallowed if they aren’t just looking to start a fight.See also:- [/c/debateanarchism](https://lemmy.ml/c/debateanarchism)- [/c/antiwork](https://lemmy.ml/c/antiwork)- [/c/solarpunk](https://lemmy.ml/c/solarpunk)- [slrpnk.net](http://slrpnk.net/)- [!anarchism@slrpnk.net](/c/anarchism@slrpnk.net)- [Anarchy101](https://lemmy.ca/c/anarchism101)- [Anarchism@lemmy.ca](https://lemmy.ca/c/anarchism)- [XMPP chat](xmpp:anarchism@chat.disroot.org?join)"
