description: "Scream Your Unpleasant thoughts into the void! Sometimes it makes them quieter! ...sometimes. (Almost) Everything is OK! I will remove only select things if they suggest other races or genders should not exist. otherwise, SCREAM.This is the corollary to [c/mentalhealth](https://lemmy.ml/c/mentalhealth) where you have to be concerned about not triggering others. Here, you can just say it and have it witnessed or temporarily vibed with. Sometimes you just gotta let the void call out to quiet it, and this space is here for you.I do recommend that you perhaps not *subscribe* to this community to avoid *regular* negativity in your browsing experience. Just let this space be here for you when the void is consuming you and you need to scream at it to get it to back off.If you do choose to respond to a poster, please try to VALIDATE them (validation =/= support/encouragement for such thoughts). You can tell them their thoughts are things that exist and that deserve to be heard without telling them that those thoughts SHOULD exist or that they are supposed to be thinking them. Doing so is an art, however, and it's ok if you have not mastered it. Thank you for being here.[ICON](https://unsplash.com/photos/82UhczjLI3E) - [BANNER](https://unsplash.com/photos/UV56KNkGbYs)"
