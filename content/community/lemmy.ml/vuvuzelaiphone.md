description: "What is this subreddit?A leftist meme/shitposting Community. That is, an online space where people can post humorous stuff centered around left-wing politics.How does the subreddit define the word “leftist”?Being against social hierarchies and wanting the workers to own the means of production. That means, if you consider Scandinavia to be a perfect utopia, social democracy will be a better fit for you. And if your lifegoal is to restore the Soviet Union, you are brain damaged . And for the Nazbols: Eat shit.What does “VuvuzelaiPhone” mean?It’s a reference to an old meme mocking the two right-wing arguments “Socialism will result in another Venezuela” and “It’s hypocritical to be a socialist if you have an iPhone”.What can be posted here?This subreddit is primarily about things that are:Related to leftism.Funni.However, we are not very strict about what we allow here. As long as your post fits at least one of the two criteria above to at least some degree, we won’t remove it for being off topic."
