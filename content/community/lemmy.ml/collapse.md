description: "This is the place for discussing the potential collapse of modern civilization and the environment.---Collapse, in this context, refers to the significant loss of an established level or complexity towards a much simpler state. It can occur differently within many areas, orderly or chaotically, and be willing or unwilling. It does not necessarily imply human extinction or a singular, global event. Although, the longer the duration, the more it resembles a ‘decline’ instead of collapse.---**RULES**1 - Remember the human2 - Link posts should come from a reputable source3 - All opinions are allowed but discussion must be in good faith.---Related lemmys:* [/c/green](https://lemmy.ml/c/green)* [/c/antreefa](https://lemmy.ml/c/antreefa)* [/c/gardening](https://lemmy.ml/c/gardening)* [/c/nativeplantgardening@mander.xyz](https://mander.xyz/c/nativeplantgardening)* [/c/eco_socialism@lemmygrad.ml](https://lemmy.ml/community/16836)* [c/collapse@sopuli.xyz](https://sopuli.xyz/c/collapse)* [/c/biology](https://lemmy.ml/c/biology)* [/c/criseciv](https://lemmy.ml/c/criseciv)* [/c/eco](https://lemmy.ml/c/eco)"
