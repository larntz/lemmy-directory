Lolcows are people and groups whose eccentric or foolish behavior can be milked for amusement and laughs. They can often think they are admired for what they are doing, but secretly are being laughed at constantly.The original sub was initially created by HaberDasher as a place to discuss a couple of streamers, Sam and Tolki, who were a married couple who run the popular twitch stream ShowVideoGames. The subreddit expanded its scope and now covers all types of discussion relating to Internet celebrity relationship drama and gossip. Stick to the Lemmy instance rules and there will be no problems."
