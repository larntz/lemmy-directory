name: "obscuremedia"
description: "What is obscure media?Anything rare, unordianary, forgotten, and/or not often seen.Some examples:- silent films- vintage exploitation flicks- finely aged TV- PSAs- Found Lost Media- Deep Youtube/Other Online videos- And more!***Rules:*****General**1) *Full and complete content*No edited short clips. If you want to highlight a specific section, link to a timestamp in the full video.2) *Include year in the title*If not known, an educated guess of the decade will suffice.Acceptable year labels:(1985) or (1980)s3) *No recently created content*In order to discourage promotion, most content created within the past ~5 years will be removed. This includes upscaled and remastered versions of vintage material.4)*No self-promotion of any kind without prior moderator approval.*If you are a content creator or would like to promote another community or a tool for finding obscure media, you must first message the moderators for approval. Failure to do so will result in a ban.5) *No links to blogs/reviews/digest pages***Youtube/other video source**1) *Videos with 100,000 views or less (at time of submission) are heavily encouraged*Videos with more than that are allowed, but you should make sure they count as obscure. Please make sure to put the view count into the title if the video came directly from an online source and didn't come from anything televised. For example, if you were to upload the latest video from Scott the Woz (which would break the rules, but it's just for example):Wii U: Birth of a Death (Part I) - Scott The Woz (2023) (776,000 views)2) *Only direct links to videos*Links to channels or playlists are prohibited. Instead, submit a direct video link and then link to the playlist or channel in the comments."
