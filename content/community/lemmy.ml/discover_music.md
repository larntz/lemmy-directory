description: "This is a place to post and discover unknown, distintive music with the potential to become mainstream. **What does it mean to be unknown?** A good indication might be that _none of the artist's music videos have more than a million views_. The fewer the better! **What does it mean to be distinctive?**_The artist should bring something novel to their music_. A distinctive sound that sets the artist's music apart from other mainstream music.The ability to create catchy, radio-friendly or otherwise easily commercially exploitable songs in established genres is not sufficient. **What does it mean to have the potential to become mainstream?** It should not be excessively demanding of the listener, such as requiring familiarity with genres, instruments or styles that are not mainstream.On the other hand, it also shouldn't have to sound good on a potato. Good music demands good fidelity."
