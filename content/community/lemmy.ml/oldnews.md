name: "oldnews"
description: "A community dedicated to discussing old news rather than new news.# Rules* Keep it old: News articles should be ones you saw *at least* a week ago, that are still on the back of your mind.* Keep it local: If you are not from Madagascar and are not impacted by Madagascar, **don't** post about Madagascar.* Keep it personal: Post things you actually care about and that you have an informed opinion on.* Discuss! All threads should make full use of the lemmy's text+link capability to explain why the article is still on your mind after a week or more. Textless posts are liable for removal."
