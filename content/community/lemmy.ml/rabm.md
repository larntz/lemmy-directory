description: "The idea of this community is to share black metal bands (can be also from other extreme genres) related with the radical left.## Rules- Be civil- By preference, try to recommend bands that are part of the movement. One good place to find these is the [Antifascist Black Metal Network](https://yewtu.be/channel/UCtjazZuy6AJ0rRtZ5bligMA) on YT.- If you need to accuse a band of something, **provide a factual proof of it**. Avoid unnecessary drama by just saying X did something bad without really providing anything to corroborate."
