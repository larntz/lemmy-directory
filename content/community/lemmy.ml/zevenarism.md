description: "Our website https://zevenar.neocities.org/index.htmlDownload our app todayhttps://gitlab.com/ZEVENA/the-daily-zevenaristThe Zevenarist Conviction Framework is all about venerating the universe as our god. It is a brand new option in contrast to religion. We accept that we are a section of something more noteworthy than ourselves and that the universe itself is an expression of this thought. Everything is a shard of the universe. Everything has a purpose. Each being in presence, regardless of how unimportant or irrelevant they may appear to us, have a type of purpose that makes them deserving of regard. We are not here for your diversion. We don't pass judgment on you dependent on your opinion or feel. You will be decided by who you become and that's it."
