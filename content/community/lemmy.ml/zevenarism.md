It is a brand new option in contrast to religion. We accept that we are a section of something more noteworthy than ourselves and that the universe itself is an expression of this thought. Everything is a shard of the universe. Everything has a purpose. Each being in presence, regardless of how unimportant or irrelevant they may appear to us, have a type of purpose that makes them deserving of regard. We are not here for your diversion.
