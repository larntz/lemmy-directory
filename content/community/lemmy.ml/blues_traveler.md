description: "Blues Traveler is a Grammy Award winning American rock band that was formed in 1987 in Princeton, New Jersey. The band's signature sound blends blues, rock, and improvisational jam band elements, highlighted by the virtuosic harmonica playing of frontman John Popper.The original lineup of Blues Traveler consisted of John Popper (vocals, harmonica), Chan Kinchla (guitar), Brendan Hill (drums), and Bobby Sheehan (bass). Bobby, however, tragically passed away in 1999. The band has since continued with Tad Kinchla on bass, along with the addition of Ben Wilson on keyboards.Blues Traveler gained widespread recognition in the 1990s with their fourth studio album, Four, featuring hit singles like Run-Around and Hook. Their success propelled them into the mainstream, solidifying their status as one of the era's most influential rock bands. After 35+ years they continue touring and creating fresh, original music today.Some album playlists: - [Blues Traveler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6PU-EC-i1jMOUobuxCusx4qWURAKPb0y)- [Travelers & Thieves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9-MKO-_GW8&list=PL_npcwEGhlcdKy3CYm3gMZKxUOGJlOb9v) - [Save his Soul](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6096F3BFDAC890DF)- [Four](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNuBnw09rXj7o2Tj6qK-cK-ikJ0N5MqEM) -  [Straight On Till Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lH3J9fQACE&list=PLtn-cbuk7a8niBrMofA6CsIijW8Kd5PKa) - [Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lXEXOL3_mvHYix75idqjE6EUwV2Bornik) - [Truth Be Told](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kyiIT16QmshQ2Zaw9IdGC2RlLLiUdPl5I) - [Â¡Bastardos!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lB8V1ZqCQVmo4z0NrY8Dm-pagd4ynj_m0) - [North Hollywood Shootout](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kw84P4_e1SLY1IsC3SqqXfVfvmysg47cs)-  [Suzie Cracks the Whip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5plM45R8hyg&list=PL0WjURR3kQq0bLxw2KQL9qi348JPpoUtW)-  [Hurry Up and Hang Around](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL56qmsC0sD9qLd1qxIzUm_7bJSagzL4jb)Official Blues Traveler website: https://bluestraveler.com/____________________________________"
