description: "This is a sublemmy (*scnr*) for discussing bans on Lemmy.You can discuss your own ban, you can discuss other people's bans. Please do not have more than one thread for an incident open at the same time. If the OP deletes their thread, you can open another one.You could format your post titles like `@helix@lemmy.ml on !announcements@lemmy.ml for being an anti-Lemmy troll`. Please don't do link posts, if you want to link to some ban announcement, do so in your post title.If you banned someone from your community, try to include a few examples of posts by them to justify the ban."
