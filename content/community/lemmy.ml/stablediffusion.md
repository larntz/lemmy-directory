description: "Welcome to the Stable Diffusion community, dedicated to the exploration and discussion of the open source deep learning model known as [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion). Introduced in 2022, Stable Diffusion uses a latent diffusion model to generate detailed images based on text descriptions and can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by text prompts. The model was developed by the startup Stability AI, in collaboration with a number of academic researchers and non-profit organizations, marking a significant shift from previous proprietary models that were accessible only via cloud services."
