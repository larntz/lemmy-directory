description: "Welcome to the community of so-called Digital Minimalists! We're community of people who seek for silence in such a noisy world and balance between real and digital worlds.Rules of this community include:1) Be honest with yourself and others. Seriously, if you're not honest with yourself and pretend to be someone else, you're not going anywhere. The first step to progression is acceptance, isn't it?2) Be polite to others and respects each others opinions. No matter what your thoughts about privacy, Big Tech, politics, nature and etc are, let's keep all discussions family-friendly and not overwhelm ourselves.3) Keep it theme-oriented. This community is not made to discuss politics, privacy-issues and climate change. It's about balance and harmony. We could discuss those topics if they are related to Digital Minimalism, but not if they're purely self-oriented.Thank you :)"
