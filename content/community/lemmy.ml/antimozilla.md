description: "This community is devoted to the respectful and reasoned criticism of Mozilla, the company behind Firefox Web Browser.**I want Firefox to succeed** but, in my opinion, Mozilla is slowly killing it by trying to make it *mainstream*, leading to a net loss of long-time users. This community serves as a place where to show your disagreement with Mozilla and to point out flaws in Firefox development.**RULES:**-  Feel free to argue respectfully.- Insults won't be tolerated.- Don't be toxic.- Bake your statements with sources or reasoning.- NO conspiracies.- Downvotes without a proper reply add nothing to the discussion."
