description: "This world is inhabited by creatures called Pok√©mon - and people love to post about them online!This community is for posts that simulate social media in the Pok√©mon universe, everything from yesterday's asktrainers question to today's PokeTwitter Drama.Rules:1. All posts should be social media in the Pokemon universe.Think creatively on what the citizens or important figures of the Pokemon world would post in their free time. Note that some level of canon divergence is allowed.Image posts only please.2. All spoilers should be marked as such.Whenever the new games come out, posts relating to them must use the Spoiler Flair for at least a month after their release.3. No Recent/Top RepostsNo reposts within 2 months (we may shorten this, we'll see how many posts we start to get) or from our top 10 of all time.4. Be civilBe civil and treat other people nicely. Bigotry and harassment will not be tolerated.Refrain from creating posts that specifically target and shoot down other people's posts.5. Use /uj when not roleplaying.Taken straight from circlejerk subs/uj (unjerk) and /rj (rejerk) represent whether you are roleplaying or not.Unjerk means your comment is serious.Rejerk is not required unless there's also a /uj in your comment and you want to differentiate between the two.6. Tag your postsThe Reddit version of this community uses Post Flairs to distinguish different genres of posts. Since Lemmy does not currently have Post Flairs, we instead ask you to tag your posts in the title, e.g. Look what my Poochyena did! [Casual], Crazy Adventure Part 3 [Storyline], etc.The available tags are:[Casual]: Down-to-earth, Slice-of-life, jokes, memes[Adventure Log]: Wacky adventures[Storyline]: Interconnected multi-post storylines[Lore/Backstory]: Loredump, Worldbuilding[Ask Me Anything]: AMAs[Question]: What Pok√©mon is this?, How do i get my mon to stop doing x?, Do your Pok√©mon ever x?[Miscellaneous]: Self-explanatory[PokeMedia Event]: Community-wide Events (ask Mods first)7. No NSFW or extreme goreYeah8. Multiversal headcanon rulesTo avoid endless fighting over what is and isn't canon, every post is in its own universe, similar yet distinct from the rest, so if you have a specific headcanon that doesn't align with a post, we can chalk that inconsistency up to the multiverse. In short, every post has its own canon decided by OP that doesn't have to perfectly align with other posts."
