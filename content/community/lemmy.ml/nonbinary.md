description: "Welcome to !non-binary,Since there wasn’t a non-binary community here I created one. As Lemmy has a small userbase it seems reasonable to not split up different non-binary content in different communities (i.e. one for memes and another one) so all non-binary content is welcome here. Have fun.Rules- no discrimination in any form- this is an antifascist community so don’t be a fascist"
