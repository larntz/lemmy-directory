description: "> Free music or libre music is music that, like free software, can freely be copied, distributed and modified for any purpose. Thus free music is either in the public domain or licensed under a free license by the artist or copyright holder themselves, often as a method of promotion. It does not mean that there should be no fee involved. The word free refers to freedom (as in free software), not to price.> -- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_music)## [The Free Music Philosophy (v1.4)](http://www.ram.org/ramblings/philosophy/fmp.html)#### ImportantLemmy doesnâ€™t have flags yet, so please tag your posts with [Question], [Help], [Other], [Promoting], [Artist], [Album], [Song] or other you may think is appropriate.#### This is a sister community of- [Free Music Archive](https://lemmy.ml/c/fma)- [funkwhale](https://lemmy.ml/c/funkwhale)- [libre.fm](https://lemmy.ml/c/librefm)- [Magnatune](https://lemmy.ml/c/magnatune)"
