description: "**Intro**Hi this is a replica of the subreddit of the same name. Small disclaimer: I never intended to be the creator or moderator here, I just was sick of waiting for someone else to do it. :)**Rules**1.  Right (or at least non-left) content only. Satire content will likely be removed2. Similar rules for comments. The topic is mocking right wing memes. This is NOT a space for political debate.3. Reposts from other sources are inevitable, however try to avoid reposting content that's already here"
