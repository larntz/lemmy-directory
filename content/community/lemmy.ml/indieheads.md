description: "For fans of indie and alternative music.For now there’s no real rules of Lemmy’s indieheads except these guidelines from the original subreddit:>We are purposely vague on a definition of “indie”. In general, music & news posts from these genres are not allowed:>Mainstream Rock/Metal Mainstream Pop Mainstream Hip Hop/R&B Mainstream Electronic & EDM>This is to encourage posts with music from more independent & underground artists. Experimental music & underground acts that exist within the banned genres will be allowed, at the discretion of the mods. Feel free to discuss features you'd like to see on this community [here](https://lemmy.ml/post/1131087?scrollToComments=true). All ideas welcome!"
