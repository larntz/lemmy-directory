description: "Some song *fragments* are just amazing. Share them here!Even though there are songs that are amazing all the way through, sadly, **this community focuses on fragments**. If you have a song that's dank all the way, you could find a particular fragment to share here, or you could share the whole song [here](https://lemmy.ml/c/music)!**Guidelines:****EITHER** share a link with the exact dank fragment (perhaps a video link that starts at the precise time) **OR** share the whole song (the name of the song or link to it) and tell us in your post what/where the dank fragment is!Share your dankness!**Note**: there is a sister *Dank Song Fragments* community over at Reddit, but it's run by the same set of mods (remember from math class that sets can even be empty). Also, that subreddit's policy is that mods will mirror the posts there in here unless someone else does it."
