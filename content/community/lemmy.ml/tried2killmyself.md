description: "Failed, not going to tell you how (because I do not know what moderation is like). Wake up here I am. I have been to Lemmy before. I do not want to live much, but I guess some of me do. Unfortunately even thought it would be logical to die (in my situation). Either ways hello and have a good day. I used to live under RMS rules / suggestions I no longer do."
