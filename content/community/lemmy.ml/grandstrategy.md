Further rules may be added if they become necessary, instance-wide rules applay.Grand strategy wargames typically focus on a war or series of wars, often over a long period of time. Individual units or armies may not be represented; instead, attention is given to theaters of operation. The resources of the nations involved may be mobilized as part of a long-term struggle. The simulation typically involves political and economic as well as military conflict.Examples include, most prominently, the Paradox Interactive catalogue of grand strategy games, including:[Imperator: Rome](https://imperator.paradoxwikis.com/Imperator_Wiki)[Crusader Kings](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Crusader_Kings_III_Wiki)[Europa Universalis](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki)[Victoria](https://vic2.paradoxwikis.com/Victoria_2_Wiki)[Hearts of Iron](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Hearts_of_Iron_4_Wiki)"
