description: "Show us your progress! Post pics of how your art used to look and how it looks now. It doesn't matter how long it takes, one day, one year, progress is progress, so show it off!    Do not post works in progress- they will be removed.    All media accepted.    Original content only.    Try to add dates or some sort of timeline (we want to know how long it took you to get better).    Let us know if you want to be critiqued adding it as link flair.    Gallery posts are fine, they don't need to be edited side-by-side.    Make as many comparison posts as you want."
