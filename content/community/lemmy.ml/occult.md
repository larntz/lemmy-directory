title: "Occult" 
name: "occult"
description: "The occult is a mixed bag of anthropology, seminal history, espionage, scientific revolution, superstition, religion, philosophy, psychology and much more. This is a place to explore every one of those aspects, and to uncover what elements of truth can be discerned from underneath the mountains of propaganda and utter bullshit which surround the subject.> **1**. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.>> **2**. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.>> **3**. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.>> -- *Arthur C. [Clarke's Three Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws)*"
