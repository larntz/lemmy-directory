Java version 1.2.5 (or equivalent) and below.Rule 2:No spam, bullying, or just crappy behavior in general.Rule 3:Properly flair your post.Rule 4:You may advertise your server only once in the pinned monthly thread. The thread will refresh every month. A server list can also be found here https://mineonline.codie.gg/serversRule 5:Do not mention ways to download hacked clients or hacks. Talking about exploits in the game is fine though.=========How to relive the Golden Age:  Over the years many Minecraft servers have updated or closed, and many versions have broken or been lost.  Fortunately, there's a strong community working on keeping the golden years alive, with new mods, texture packs, servers, all sorts.  If you're new to the community here are some recommendations:• **Modification Station** is the go-to place for old mods. https://discord.gg/8Qky5XY  • **Omniarchive** is a large community of archivists who have found many previously lost versions of Minecraft. https://discord.gg/h45wxnE    - If you're looking for an old version, go here.  • **Betacraft** hosts an archive of old server software. https://betacraft.pl/server-archive/minecraft/Originally from r/GoldenAgeMinecraft"
