description: "This is a fun sub gathering every unbroken people of Lemmy of all age and from all countries.The aim of this sub is to talk about the solidity of our bones, share fun anecdotes about others' brittle bones, memes about milk consumption and so on.Regarding this last point : milk consumption IS encouraged ! Milk DOES make your bones stronger ! Anyone thinking that this is propaganda from diary lobbying is probably part of the Illuminati and want to terminate us stronk-boned people to dominate the world.You may be allowed not to drink milk, but you belong to the lower layers of our community and you're being watched, as you may be more fragile.The rules are simple :1. Be nice to each other ffs, this is a fun sub.1b. It is ok to be nasty with useless broken people on their way out though, but keep it to bones.2. Denunciation is encouraged. Report any broken person in this sub !These rules might be modified or extended at any time.DRINK MILK !!!!"
