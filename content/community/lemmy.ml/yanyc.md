description: "Welcome to **YANYC (You Are Not Your Code)** - A community dedicated to peer-to-peer code review, where we believe that the code is just code, not a reflection of the coder. This is a place for constructive, professional discussion and a chance to refine your craft. We're here to support each other, help identify bugs, discuss design patterns, enhance code readability, and generally improve our programming skills together. Before you dive in, please keep in mind the following ground rules for our community:* **Be Respectful:** We treat each other with respect, no matter the skill level. Criticism should always be thoughtful and constructive. Never berate a fellow member because of their code.* **All Code is Welcome:** We welcome code from all languages, frameworks, and skill levels. We're here to learn from each other, and that means we need to be open to all kinds of code.* **No Homework or Work Assignment Submissions:** This is not a place to get your homework or work assignments done for you. Submitted code should be functionally complete or nearly so, and represent your own work.* **Contribution Expectation:** We believe in give and take. If you're submitting code for review, consider contributing by reviewing some code as well.* **Maintain Professionalism:** We maintain a professional environment here. Irrelevant discussions, personal attacks, or any form of harassment is strictly prohibited.By participating in this community, you agree to abide by these rules. Let's create a respectful space for learning, collaboration, and growth.Happy coding, everyone!**Resources:**No affiliation with the following resources, but they're great reads!* [How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human (Part One)](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/)* [How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human (Part Two)](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-2/)* [How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/)"
