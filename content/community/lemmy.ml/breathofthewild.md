For example, a post like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/61z7t1/make_chests_great_again/) is allowed, it's not taking a side, it's a Zelda play on a common meme. However, future posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/62fcij/if_it_starts_to_rain_im_blaming_the_democrats/) will be removed due to bashing a political party.*4. **Off topic***Posts unrelated to the subreddit.*5. **No porn***Go somewhere else for that.*"
