name: "gnomeunofficial"
description: "The GNOME Project is a free and open source desktop and computing platform for open platforms like Linux that strives to be an easy and elegant way to use your computer. GNOME software is developed openly and ethically by both individual contributors and corporate partners, and is distributed under the GNU General Public License.**This Lemmy community is not affiliated with the GNOME project.**### Rules: **1. Trolling, flamewars, or poor discussion**We ask all users to follow the [GNOME Code of Conduct](https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct). Top violations of this rule are trolling, starting a flamewar, shitposting, or not remembering the human aka being hostile or incredibly impolite.**2. No memes, image macros, or rage comics**Meme posts are not allowed. Feel free to post over at [!linuxhumor](https://lemmy.ml/c/linuxhumor) instead.**3. Relevance to GNOME community**Posts should follow what the community likes: GNOME, GNOME development, GNOME applications, the GNOME foundation, GTK+, Flatpak or Flathub, and more. Take some time to get the feel of the community if you're not sure!**4. Post and dash**Posting content is welcome (duh), but we do ask that you contribute more than just your content to the subreddit. We as well require you stick around and interact with the comments of your submission. If you post something and abandon it, it may be treated as spam.**5. No misdirected links, paywalls, or URL shorteners**In short: if your link doesn't go right to the content it will be removed. Sites that require a login to view the content are not allowed. Example: A private Facebook post or a news organization that doesn't have free article views. URL shorteners and links that misdirect users to ads/jokes are also banned.**6. NSFW**No NSFW links or content.**7. No rage posts**We do not shy away from criticism, in fact, we encourage it! However, criticisms of GNOME must be accompanied with valid, well reasoned arguments. Posts that contain no original content and are meant to just spread hatred and anger will not be tolerated.**8. Spam**For obvious reasons, spam is not tolerated. Spam content will be removed, and spam accounts will be banned. This also applies to bot accounts.##### *The above description and rules were adapted from [The GNOME Community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/).*"
