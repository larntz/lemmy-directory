description: "This is a general purpose Valorant community on Lemmy.Discuss the game, esports and patches. Post questions. Post your clips. Post your memes.I want as little restrictions as possible and as little rules as I can get away with. So for now there is only a handful of rules. Maybe I will create more specific rules as soon as this community gets more activity. Let's see. There is a Matrix space available:https://matrix.to/#/#valorant:tchncs.de**Rules**1) Use common sense2) No witch hunting, no doxxing3) You are free to discuss cheating as an issue but you cannot promote cheating or link to cheat providers4) zero tolerance for hate speech5) Don't spam. You can promote your team, event or project. But please ask for permission first. Just contact me on lemmy or message me on matrix first.6) No NSFW content**@honk:tchncs.de**"
