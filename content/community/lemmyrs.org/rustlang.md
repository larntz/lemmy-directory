description: "# Rules [Developing]## Observe our code of conduct- Strive to treat others with respect, patience, kindness, and empathy.- We observe the Rust Project Code of Conduct.- Submissions must be on-topic- Posts must reference Rust or relate to things using Rust. For content that does not, use a text post to explain its relevance.- Post titles should include useful context.- For Rust questions, use the stickied Q&A thread. [TBD]- Arts-and-crafts posts are permitted on weekends.- No meta posts; message the mods instead.## Constructive criticism only- Criticism is encouraged, though it must be constructive, useful and actionable.- If criticizing a project on GitHub, you may not link directly to the project’s issue tracker. Please create a read-only mirror and link that instead.- Keep things in perspective- A programming language is rarely worth getting worked up over.- No zealotry or fanaticism.- Be charitable in intent. Err on the side of giving others the benefit of the doubt.## No endless relitigation- Avoid re-treading topics that have been long-settled or utterly exhausted.- Avoid bikeshedding.- This is not an official Rust forum, and cannot fulfill feature requests. Use the official venues for that.## No low-effort content- Showing off your new projects is fine## No memes or image macros- Please find other communities to post memes## No NSFW Content- There are many other NSFW communities, let’s keep this related to the language"
