description: "For screenshots of humorous, clean, **nonpolitical** social media posts. This primarily implies Twitter, but Facebook, Tumblr, Mastodon, Bluesky, etc. are allowed too.###### Rules1. Again, no politics.2. No Lemmy posts. You're already on a Lemmy instance. There's no need to screenshot it and post it here.3. No Reddit posts. That's too similar to Lemmy.4. The joke must be text. Images can be included in the screenshot, but only as needed context.5. Use correct cropping. Don't have a mile of whitespace or show extraneous UI, but don't crop out the date or author.6. No doxxing. Again, don't crop out the author's name as he or she has chosen to share it, but definitely do not share extra information which may be personally identifiable or libelous.7. Link to the original post either in the body or in a comment.We are obviously not affiliated with Twitter in any way."
