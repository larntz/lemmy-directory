description: "A community for autistic pride and autistic people - ABA apologia and similar things not welcome.Not affiliated with the subreddit - or it's mod - in any way (outside of having the same topic), just putting a community here to start getting people together and sort something better out once the community has actual people, because I don't have the time or energy to moderate."
