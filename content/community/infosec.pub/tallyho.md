description: "The unofficial home on Lemmy for the YT channel Sampson Boat Company, which documents rebuilding Tally Ho, a beautiful wooden boat originally built in 1910.Starring the Duchess of Desire. From Leo: *I’m on a mission to rebuild a 1910 English sailing yacht called Tally Ho. Designed by Albert Strange in 1909, she is a well-known and important historic vessel – but after many adventures she was left in a remote port in Oregon to rot for decades, despite some valiant attempts to rescue her. I bought her and moved her to the Olympic Peninsular earlier this year, and am now rebuilding her from the keel up. Eventually I hope to sail her back to the UK.*"
