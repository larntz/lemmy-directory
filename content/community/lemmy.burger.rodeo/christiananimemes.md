description: "> I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. - 1 Corinthians 9:22A place to post memes from weeb-related media (e.g. anime, manga, visual novels) that is also related to Christianity.**Rules**- Be nice, kind, and courteous to each other. It's easy to assume the worst of others, but at least try to make an attempt to understand where others are coming from, even if you may not agree with them. [The quality of mercy is not strained](https://interestingliterature.com/2020/11/portia-quality-of-mercy-is-not-strained-speech-analysis/), after all.- Satire/ironic takes are fine, but be respectful of each another and take any keyboard fights/bashing outside. This is a place to laugh, smile, and maybe even spur others on to good deeds/goodness, but not a place for theological or doctrinal debates.- **NSFW rule: Mark your post as NSFW if it contains explicit sex or gratuitous nudity. When in doubt, NSFW it for the browsing safety of your fellow users.**"
