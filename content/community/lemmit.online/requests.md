description: "# Request a subredditMake requests for new subreddits/communities here, **using the name of the subreddit as the title**, or with **a link to the subreddit as the url**.For **anything else**, go to [!about@lemmit.online](/c/about@lemmit.online).#### Warning: Use common sense when requesting.If you're gonna request a ton of stuff, or things you're not even going to follow yourself, you'll be wasting the time of the bot, your fellow Lemmy users, and the admin/dev.I would very much recommend against that."
