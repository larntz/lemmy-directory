description: "# Request a subredditMake requests for new subreddits/communities here, **using the name of the subreddit as the title**, or with **a link to the subreddit as the url**.For **anything else**, go to [!about@lemmit.online](/c/about@lemmit.online).## Requests for NSFW subs should be marked as such.They often have nsfw thumbnails, and will show up unblurred on other servers.## Warning: Use common sense when requesting.**Comments are not copied over.** So requests for `explainLikeImFive` or `askMidgets` are useless, since you'll never get the answers here.Also keep in mind that each sub you request here takes resources to process forevermore. So, you know, show some restraint."
