description: "A community about anarchy and anarchism for SLRPNK! Solarpunk anarchist unite!Feel free to ask questions here. This is a safe space. SLRPNK.net's basic rules apply here. * * * * > Poetry and imagination must be integrated with science and technology, for we have evolved beyond an innocence that can be nourished exclusively by myths and dreams.~ Murray Bookchin, *The Ecology of Freedom*> People want to treat ‘we’ll figure it out by working to get there’ as some sort of rhetorical evasion instead of being a fundamental expression of trust in the power of conscious collective effort. ~Anonymous, but quoted by Mariame Kaba, *We Do This 'Til We Free Us*> The end justifies the means. But what if there never is an end? All we have is means.~Ursula K. Le Guin, *The Lathe of Heaven* > There can be no separation of the revolutionary process from the revolutionary goal. *A society based on self-administration must be achieved by means of self-administration.*~Murray Bookchin, *Post Scarcity Anarchism*"
