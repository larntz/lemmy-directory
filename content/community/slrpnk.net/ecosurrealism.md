description: "We need to resist lithium and other raw materials mining in our backyards with solidarity with the peoples of the global south. Elon musk bought twitter so he can silence the protests against lithium mining all over the world, which are making the price of lithium to skyrocket. Also for the lithium batteries  nickel is an essential metal being the extraction of nickel the biggest social catastrohpe... There's nothing left but to not fall into solutionisms like the electrical car. Down with the electrical car, down with lithium, down with green capitalism, embrace degrowth, before degrowth and chaos embrace you. Stop consuming now.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ4cpOKmde8"
