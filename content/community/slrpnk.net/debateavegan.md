description: "Welcome to Debate A Vegan. This is a place to have civil discussions about ethical veganism and animal rights.Rules:1. Respect one another. It is okay to attack positions, but ad hominems are not allowed.2. Argue in good faith and don't be quick to assume bad faith. Do not try to win an argument at the cost of being honest.3. Try to use the Socratic method as much as possible: ask questions. This prevents people from feeling personally attacked while encouraging them to think about their position.4. In the likely event that both debate partners are not immediately convinced of the others position after a discussion, agree to disagree. If a person wants to end the debate, so be it. Rule 5 being an exception.5. If someone repeatedly refuses to respond to a certain criticism of their argument, they should either respond or stop making that argument.These rules may be changed."
