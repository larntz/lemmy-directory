description: "# AboutEver wanted to info dump about your ocs but didn't want to be annoying? This is your new happy place. Share your ocs, adopts, lore, and toyhouse codes to like minded friends!## Rules#### 1, Posts Must Have Flairs in Title- Adopt: for any posts with characters that are looking for new homes. Artist MUST be credited somewhere in the post- Mine by (artist): for sharing ocs that you didn't design but that you own. (artist) should be replaced with the designer's handle- Mine: for sharing ocs that you *did* design and that you own. Please don't share designs that you created but no longer own here#### 2, OCs Must Be Owned By YouThis isn't a community for posting ocs that you like or admire. Please also don't share ads for other people's adopts- this is considered rule evading regardless of whether a rule was broken#### 3, NSFW Policy- Absolutely no NSFW depicting minors is allowed- Suggestive art and poses is allowed with adult OCs- Any full nudity must be *tasteful* i.e. nothing sexually explicit- Gore is fine. NSFW inside of a linked toyhouse page is fine, but the page must have a content warning on it#### 4, Respect- Be nice! Don't talk bad about other people's ocs or lore. If someone asks for feedback give constructive criticism. Let's uplift each other - No gatekeeping. If you used an art base, link somewhere for other people to check it out! If you used an HTML base link it! If you used a picrew link it!! Links are friends"
