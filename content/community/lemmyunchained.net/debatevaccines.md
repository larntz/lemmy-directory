description: "A reddit refuge for the r/debatevaccines subreddit.*Debate and discuss issues surrounding vaccinations.***#DebateVaccines Rules:****1. Post requirements:**Posts should be for good-faith discussion about vaccines and related policy issues. Posts with links must contain text summarizing the point the poster is attempting to make.Memes, off topic, treatment-related, vaccine injury, or posts that attempt to provoke rather than discuss will be removed, with particularly egregious violators subject to bans.**2. Be civil, no personal attacks****3. No ad hominems:**Ad hominem is when an argument is rebutted by attacking the appearance, intelligence, or other irrelevant attribute of the person making the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.However, some criticism is not ad hominem, for example, questioning the motive, conflict of interest, or honesty of the person making the argument, as this has direct baring on the validity of the argument itself**4. No trolling or spam****5. Image/video posts must include source and summary:**Image/video posts require sources to be linked in a top-level comment."
