description: "Rules and stuff\u00a01. Please keep all requests [SFW](https://lemmy.fmhy.ml/post/112491)!  2. FMHY has a [very detailed index of sites](https://fmhy.pages.dev/) to search through. Please try your best to check there before you make your request here. Odds are it's there. 3. Linking directly to pirated files is strictly forbidden on this instance. You can DM direct links or post the homepage of where the file is. **DO NOT SHARE DIRECT LINKS TO PIRATED FILES OUTSIDE OF DMs** 4. Please be descriptive when asking for a file. Let us know what OS you need the software for. Tell us whether or not [title] is a movie or game. Give as much detail as you believe to be necessary for us to help you. 5. Use caution when opening a link or file. FMHY offers a [multitude of safety options](https://fmhy.pages.dev/adblockvpnguide/) that you should take advantage of. 6. Be kind! Say thanks when your request has been fulfilled. Edit your post to let us know it's been taken care of. Take a moment to check the replies and see if someone else is looking for the same file. You are encouraged to forward the link to others through DMs!"
