description: "A community to talk about anything dealing with christianity. It's history, theology or personal experiences and beliefs.This is no place for bigotry of any kind. Discussion of bigotry within a christian context is of course allowed, but no furtherance of it. E.g. it's ok to post about how gay people are excluded by most churches from hosting a wedding, it's not ok to post in support of it."
