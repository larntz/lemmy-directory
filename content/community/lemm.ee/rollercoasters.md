description: "A place to talk about roller coasters and parks that have them. Everyone is welcome here to both learn and to celebrate these magnificent machines designed to scare you.Here are some important resources:1) [RCDB](https://www.rcdb.com)2) [Thrill Data](https://www.thrill-data.com/)3) [Coast2Coaster](https://www.coast2coaster.com/)4) [Terminology and Abbreviations](https://lemm.ee/post/661246)Images are welcome if they are of high quality and it doesn't get out of hand. Please use [PostImages](https://postimages.org/) to upload your image and then use that link in the URL field of your post (other image sites are permitted but Post Images has the best policies and compatibility).Some basic rules:1) Opinions, theories, and facts are all welcome – but be clear about what you’re saying. 2) Back up facts with sources as much as possible3) No spam or sell-promotion. Linking to your own media or site is permissible only if it’s specifically related to a topic/post that someone else created.4) No photos or videos taken on the rides. This is dangerous and shouldn't be encouraged.5) Limit political discussion. When discussed it must be park related.6) No fictional coasters (models, no limits, planet coaster, etc)7) No posting personal information.8) No shaming of anyone. We all can continue to learn and not everyone knows everything -- and that's ok."
