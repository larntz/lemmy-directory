description: "Intelligent dance music (commonly abbreviated as IDM) is a style of electronic music originating in the early 1990s, defined by idiosyncratic experimentation rather than specific genre constraints. It emerged from the culture and sound palette of electronic and rave music styles such as ambient techno, acid house, Detroit techno and breakbeat; it has been regarded as better suited to home listening than dancing. Prominent artists associated with it include Aphex Twin, Autechre, Squarepusher, Venetian Snares, Boards of Canada, Telefon Tel Aviv, μ-Ziq, the Black Dog, the Future Sound of London, and Luke Vibert.**Post rules:**- Use `[𝕋𝔸𝔾] Artist - Song` format- Use these as tags until we have something better:  - `[ℕ𝔼𝕎]` - for new releases  - `[𝔸𝕃𝔹𝕌𝕄]` - for links to full albums  - `[𝕍𝕀𝔻𝔼𝕆]` - for music videos- Please share links to official frontends, e.g. to youtube instead of piped or invidious.
