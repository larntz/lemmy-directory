If we see that your account or c/gameboy activity is overwhelmingly used for self-promotion, your posts will be removed. If any self-promoting post gets reported to the moderators in great numbers, moderators are unlikely to protect/defend it.6.Rule 6: Post 'counterfeit cartridge' questions in the Fake Cart Thread7.Rule 7: Use common senseModerators reserve the right to remove your post or take other action, even for things that are not expressly specified in the above rules. For example, spamming will result in moderator action, and nobody should be surprised when it does. If you have any questions or feedback, message the moderators and let us know!"
