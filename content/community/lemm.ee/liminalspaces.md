description: "Welcome to Liminal Space, a space for liminal spaces!**What are liminal spaces?**Different people have their own ideas of what a liminal space is, but in essence, liminal spaces are places that are not destinations, but transitory places such as hallways, waiting rooms, or stations. Liminality itself is a state of transition between two separate states.In practice, the definition of a liminal space has been stretched to invoke an aesthetic more than a rigid definition. Empty places that should be full, like a school at night. The Backrooms, a fictional horror meme about a backstage area outside the scope of normal reality.**What's this community for?**Well, really it's just a place to post things that you think of as liminal spaces. I'd think most submissions would be photographs, but heck, if you've got a game, a movie, anything that makes you think liminal space, go ahead and post it! Let's get those lonely and uncanny vibes flowing in here!"
