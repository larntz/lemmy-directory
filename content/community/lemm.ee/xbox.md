Sometimes, we talk about cross platform games here, that's okay!- No Self-Promo please! (As cool as your last Overwatch or Warzone montage is, this isn't the place for it!)- Memes are totally welcome, as long as they are related to Xbox in some way- When in doubt, err on the side of being kind or not saying anything at all**If you're interested in being a mod or helping to post content, please reach out to me!**"
