description: "A community for NSFW photographers to post their work and talk about their trade. All genders and presentations welcome.**RULES**1) Original content (OC) only. Only post your own work. You must be the photographer! It's fine if you're also the model. - 1a) Be prepared to prove what you post is your own, like the RAW (or original JPG) file with intact EXIF or a psd with your layers visible.- 1b) No screencaps or other low-effort posts, only composed, deliberate photographs. If you're posting a still from your webcam, it better be really really damn good. 2) Photography only. No AI art! No work that may have started as a photograph but is now mostly AI art! Images that rely heavily on AI backgrounds (like greenscreen images) may be allowed on a case-by-case basis, but are mostly discouraged. Use of AI tools like AI skin smoothing or AI upscaling is allowed unless it's extreme.- 2a) Composites are fine if the elements of the composite are all your own work. 3)  No advertising! That means no links to OF/Patreon/Fansly/smugmug or any other site in which anyone collects money for anything. Don't put it in your post and not in the comments to your post. If you have a link in your profile, that's fine. - 3a) If you have some kind of nonprofit solicitation, like a charity drive for the Free Speech Coalition or something, check with mods first.4) Flag your posts NSFW unless they aren't.5) Text posts are fine as long as they are on-topic and tagged [Text].- 5a) Use [Gallery] for any post that contains more than one or two images. Gallery posts are generally discouraged and if you do it too often we'll ask you to stop. Links in a comment to galleries hosted elsewhere are fine.6) Requred imagepost level tags: [Lewd], [Nude], [Explicit], [Hardcore]- 6a) [Nude] includes toplessness (visible nipples) **OF ANY GENDER.** The mods don't want to be in the business of figuring out what counts as NSFW nipples and what doesn't, so any visible nipple **OF ANY GENDER** should be flagged [Nude].- 6b) [Explicit] includes any open leg, any buttholes on display, and any erect penises.- 6c) [Hardcore] includes any sexual activity of any kind, including masturbation, ejaculation, or any explicit sexual activity between two or more people.- 6d) When in doubt, go for the higher level. If posting multiple images of multiple levels, tag with the highest level.7) **No images of anyone <18 years old of any kind**, even if they happen to be SFW and completely innocent in nature. None. **No discussions of such images** either. If there's one rule that will get you immediately shitcanned if you break it, it's this one. - 7a) Any posts containing unconventional fetishes (including but not limited to scat, hot lunch, blood, violent play, CNC, vore) must be tagged in the post title. If in doubt, tag it.- 7b) Furry stuff is okay, I guess, as long as it conforms with all the other rules. No bestiality content. 8) Be nice. If you can't be nice, keep it to yourself.- 8a) No body shaming of any kind, no homophobia, transphobia, kink shaming, or nazi shit. If there are two rules that will get you immediately shitcanned if you break them, it's 7) and this one. Mods are woke and queer and angry. 9) If you want critiques or need technical help, indicate that in your post subject and then post any relevant information in a top-level comment. This includes stuff like your camera, exposure, aperture, iso, lighting, and the intent of your image.- 9a) A request for a critique is not a license to be a dbag. Keep your criticism constructive, please. Do not offer unsolicited critiques. If you really really really feel like you have something critical to say, you can ask if someone wants a critique in a post comment. No reply means no.- 9b) If you ask for a critique and you get one, please take the time to reply and thank the person for their time. Also, don't get salty about critiques you don't like. You literally asked for it. "
