description: "The community about tastefully fit anime girlsRules   * Be chill. We don't think this actually needs to be said, but please be nice towards other users.   * No unnecessarily lewd content We're trying to keep this sub tasteful, and differentiate ourselves from our lewder sisterpages. That means less blown up anatomy, less revealed skin, less intrinsically lewd poses.* If those things sound like something you're into, I implore you check out r/FitDrawnGirls and r/musclegirlart.   * Mark NSFW when it applies. Certain lewdness is 100% still Fit Moe. We do ask you mark it NSFW.   * No Reposts. Please don't repost anything from the top 100 or anything that has been posted here in the last 6 months.   * Posts must be Fit Moe. Fit anime girls is what the sub is meant for, don't go posting other things.* AI art is permanently banned without exception, if you want it, you might want to make your own lemmy page, with blackjack and AI.Fit means that the girl in the artwork has to have a decent level of fitness. Cardiobunnies, girls with abs, that sort of thing.Moe means the girl has to be cute. The type of girl you'd find on r/Awwnime, except displaying her fitness.    Add sources.
