Certain lewdness is 100% still Fit Moe. We do ask you mark it NSFW.   * No Reposts. Please don't repost anything from the top 100 or anything that has been posted here in the last 6 months.   * Posts must be Fit Moe.

Cardiobunnies, girls with abs, that sort of thing.Moe means the girl has to be cute. The type of girl you'd find on r/Awwnime, except displaying her fitness.    Add sources.
