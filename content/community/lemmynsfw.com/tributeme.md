description: "Try a Tribute!It might seem weird at first, but seeing yourself covered in guys' cum is strangely arousing, curiously satisfying, and surprisingly fun. It's like having a memory of something you never actually did. Being able to try it and talk about it openly, safely, and in a supportive environment, is pleasantly liberating... and somewhat addictive; you can't understand until you've tried it yourself! - anon.TributeMe is the home of consensual tributes. Verified ladies request tributes to their photos or videos, and other Redditors share their appreciation for all to see. Video cum tributes preferred, but all tributes welcome.Posting here is not an invitation to chat, message, cam, or hookup.Tributees: Verify, then post your pic or video as a tribute request. We accept Redgif and Erome video and picture tributes. (must directly link to the pic or vid, not an album). Don’t feel bad about blocking private messages or chats.Tributers: Record your tribute, upload it to Erome, Redgifs and then share the link in a comment on the post you’re tributing. (Tributes must include the pic or vid from the post.) Also include the appropriate tag in your comment: [cock pic], [cock vid], [cum pic], or [cum vid]. (If you don't have a cock, please feel free to make up your own tag.)To reply to a tribute request, you must have actually shared a tribute. For your first comment, just include the appropriate tribute tag (rule 15), and a moderator will review it to confirm that it contains a valid tribute (rule 13).RULES1. All users must be 18 or older.2. Tribute requests must come from verified females. See verification instructions. (Trans women and couples accounts with her consent are allowed.) If you delete your verification post or photos, your verification will be revoked.3. No promoting or selling in TributeMe. Accounts that sell elsewhere are allowed, but only if they're generating sufficient tributes. 4. No more than one request post per 20 hours. If you make a mistake in your post, you may delete it within the first 30 minutes and repost right away. Verification posts are exempt, so you may post again as soon as you're verified.Album/gallery posts are allowed, but they must be from a single photoshoot. Please do not dump a bunch of unrelated photos in a single post.5. No TributeMe reposts. Material you've posted elsewhere on Reddit is welcome.6. [Meta] posts are for general discussion of tributes. Anyone may submit a discussion text post with a [Meta] tag in the title, but requesting or offering tributes in [Meta] posts is not allowed.7. Keep it real (no significantly altered photos or videos). Cropping, color balancing, and blurring/censoring sensitive parts is allowed; changing the size or shape of body parts is not. Faking or re-using cumshots is not allowed, and her request must naturally be in the frame, not edited together as a composite.8. Be respectful. Negative, offensive, or discouraging comments are not acceptable. Degrading terms like slut or whore are only allowed if the requestor specifically asks to be degraded.9. Do not mention or ask for usernames for other services. This includes Kik, Snapchat, Skype, email, carrier pigeon, or anything other than this site. You may put other usernames in your profile, but you may not mention them in TributeMe.10. Do not mention private messages or promise anything in exchange for tributes. TributeMe is at its best when tributes and replies are public for everyone to enjoy. If you have earned reverse tribute flair, you may mention that you will reverse tribute your favorite. If you do not post a reverse tribute within a week, you will lose the flair.11. Do not ask if a requester wants a tribute or how to send a tribute. If they’re posting here, they want tributes. Record your tribute, then upload it to  Erome, or Redgifs, and share the link. If you are honestly confused, message the mods or make a [Meta] post.12. Do not attempt to identify anyone. Privacy must be respected!13. Cock or cum pics/vids must include the request and must not contain other pics/vids. Do not post a tribute of a different pic/vid.14. Do not link to a video until it finishes encoding. If Erome is taking too long, try Redgifs!15. Tag your tribute as [cock pic], [cock vid], [cum pic], or [cum vid]. Include the appropriate one in your comment. If your tribute does not fit into one of those categories, please make up your own tag and message the mods so we can approve it."
