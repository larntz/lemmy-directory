description: "# Introduction I don’t know what I’m doing, but I enjoyed the reddit experience of upvoting good porn and promoting models etc. Very curatorial. Also hopefully the porn people can get the fediverse going. Basically this community is a clearinghouse for multiple porn subreddits that used GIFS. I’m seeing a lot of subreddits migrating, but with no content or activity. I’m hoping that by consolidating we can get the community active before niches break out.## Rules - Standard instance rules apply, obviously. - Preferably GIFS - OC and promotions fine as long as it’s GIFS, but make it good.- REDGIFS seems to work best. Imgur and reddit not so much. https://catbox.moe/ is also being suggested on Lemmy. I haven’t really tested that because I don’t upload porn or really anything.- Subs that I’m drawing from r/nsfw_gifs, r/NSFWGIFS, r/porninfifteenseconds, r/porninaminute, r/extramile, and more. Avoiding fetishes and posting mostly from the mainstream stuff. Quality GIFS ripped from reddit basically. I don’t want to do this, so if some porn enthusiasts want to take over  and run it properly that’d be great. I’m pretty much just going to spend a couple minutes a day. This sub will likely die, but hopefully it can help generate momentum for Lemmy.Will add more rules soon"
