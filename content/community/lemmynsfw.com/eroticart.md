description: "# Welcome to Erotic Art!A community for artwork which titillates or arouses the viewer. This is not a hentai community, there's plenty of those on here. Rather, it's for erotic or pornographic art in a non-cartoon style, whether new or old (historical paintings are welcome too). Hentai need not be disqualified, but look at what's already in here and use your best judgement.> Erotic artwork is a diverse category of visual arts that includes any artistic creation meant to elicit erotic pleasure, typically representing human nakedness as well as sexual behavior. Sexual artwork may be discovered in practically every visual media, such as sketches, engravings, movies, erotic paintings, photography, and sculptural works. ::: spoiler Just a heads upYou need to create an account or enable NSFW in your current account to view the content in this community:::# Guide to Tags**All posts must be tagged.**[Soft] - No penetration, no / minimal bodily fluids[Hard] - Any penetration or excessive bodily fluids[Fetish] - Hopefully self-explanatory, but a non-exhaustive list: BDSM, pee, bizarre bodily proportions (disproportionate breasts, penises, etc.), futa, etc. Most of these are rare in content that would be found in this sub, but if it otherwise fits, it sits, so long as it's tagged appropriately.Historical art is not exempt from the tagging rules. E.g. [The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tako_to_ama_retouched.jpg) would fall under [Fetish], regardless of its historical nature.# RulesFollow instance-wide rules and:- Try to use the actual title of a piece for the post title, if it exists / you can find it.- As mentioned above, stick to erotic art which is not in a cartoon style, !hentai, !rule34 and their ilk exist, so please help keep this community focused.- Yes, photography is an art form, it's even mentioned in the quoted blurb, no it is not welcome here, there's plenty of communities for that. The same applies for film.- No gore, vore, scat or anything that would be considered very extreme.- Corollary to the above rule: Rape is allowed, as to disallow it would also disallow a lot of historical paintings which outright hang in museums. **However,** the artistic merit of such will be judged much more harshly, in a manner proportionate to how graphic it is. Tag-wise, any non-historical examples likely fall under [Fetish], though feel free to ping a mod and ask for reclassification if you believe it's fine under [Hard].- No low effort posts (low quality images/videos, black bars, etc.)- No aI generated content. If you want to post anything AI generated use the relevant communities, such as !aigen- All posts must be tagged- Loli / shota (that is, depictions of apparently underaged subjects, whether) is banned, as per instance rules. Yes, it can be hard to tell, what one person considers loli / shota another might just consider petite, use your best judgement, and the mods will use theirs. Don't sweat it if a post gets removed, but if you're starting to become a problem, you'll get DMed / temp-banned before you get permed.if possible please also provide the sauce (link to artist etc) in the body of your post.If you have any suggestions or ideas for the community please feel free to message @securitas."
