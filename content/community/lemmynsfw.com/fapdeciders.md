description: "##### Welcome to fapdeciders. This is a channel for people looking for other people to give them directions on how to fap.**How it works**Make a post here on the subreddit. Post ought include the following information:gender you identify as- sexual orientation- toys on hand- any physical limitations (i.e. can not be on knees for extended periods of time)- preferences/fantasies- what you don't like/wouldn't be into- time limit/availability (please be aware that if you only have an hour or so, you're not likely to see much attention to your post)- Posts now require post flair, denoting what you're looking for.In your post title, please include an x4x designation (e.g., m4f, nb4a). We may start filtering out posts that do not include this in the near future.For the most part, posters on this subreddit do not need to be verified. That said, there are now several ways that users can get verified:- A user may post (or pm the mods) a gonewild-style verification picture, and we will grant you the flair of your choice.- A person may message the mod team on another user's behalf telling us that someone is fun to play with (either giving or receiving commands), and we will give that person an appropriate flair after confirming that that uses wants it.- Last, if you make an extreme post that we think might be fake we reserve the right to ask you to verify. If you do not, we might remove your post/and or ban you... This primarily affects destroy my life and deny me forever posts.After you postYour post constitutes a promise that you will follow instructions to the letter (or find the closest possible substitute). Sessions should respect your limits, so please communicate them clearly both before and during.Nitty-Gritty- This is NOT a version of GW. Some people may be willing to post pictures, some may not. Please no comments that simply say, show us your tits. Take that shit elsewhere.- Respect all posters. No means no, unless in the context of your scene it might mean yes. In which case, there had better be a safe word in place that will actually mean no.Play safely and have a great fap!! :)"
