description: "A lemming for sharing discussions and representations of socks being used or experienced as sources of sexual gratification (a/k/a all things soxy, hehe). The intent is for this to be a tightly scoped but loosely moderated lemming, meaning it will have few rules but those rules will be strictly enforced.##### Rule No. 1:The subject of your post _**must clearly include at least one sock**_ (pairs are preferable), and place it within a sexual context.- It can be any kind of sock that you find compelling, so long as it/they are socks and not stockings, legwarmers or pantyhose.- It can be worn, inserted into, or used to stimulate/arouse a person of any gender or sexual orientation. This can take place in solitude or in the presence of others in any combination of gender or orientation, so long as all persons described or depicted are older than the legal age of consent in their jurisdiction of residence and granted permission for their likeness or identity to be shared here.##### Rule No. 2:See Rule No. 1.----Alright, let the shenanigans commence and let's see/talk about those socks."
