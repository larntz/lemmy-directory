description: "Currently, just a collection of things I've saved and reposted, to further content on LemmyNSFW. Content is not any specific category, just things I like.I provide sources where I have them. Trying to be sparing with posted unsourced content, accreditation is important. Originally was saving stuff just for myself so don't always have sources, especially if the original is unsourced.Also, these are my kinks, not my politics. Being turned on by problematic shit isn't the same as endorsing it, what's posted here is porn, not manifesto. Racial and gender equity, trans rights, positive, enthusiastic, informed consent, etc, those are things I believe in, and I reserve the right to deal harshly with anyone in comments who feels otherwise."
