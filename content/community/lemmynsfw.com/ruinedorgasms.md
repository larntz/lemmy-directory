description: "OC posters are especially welcomed. Please invite them, help spread the word.---**What is a ruined (handsfree) orgasm?**There are two coexisting definitions.a) *Ruined* Orgasm - It's the act of stopping all stimulation just as the orgasm contractions start occurring; the resulting orgasm is thus *ruined * and extremely frustrating, as it decreases the libido without providing any actual pleasure. It is a common method of tease and denial seen in femdom.b) *Abandoned* Orgasm - It's the act of stopping all stimulation just before the orgasm contractions start occurring - therefore, it's not actually an orgasm, just an ejaculation. It's arguably much more pleasurable than option A, however it's still quite frustrating.In addition, there is the concept of hangtime, which is the amount of time from when stimulation is removed to the time of the first emission. The record hangtime AFAIK is around 7.4 seconds - proof https://lemmynsfw.com/post/48972---If you don't want to simply frustrate your pet, but want to provide a bit more zing instead, check out [!postorgasm@lemmynsfw.com](https://lemmynsfw.com/c/postorgasm) ---Not affliated with r/RuinedOrgasms, but I (b98) used to post quite a lot on there, and the mods of that sub that know me, know that this community exists and may eventually point redditors to here.---"
