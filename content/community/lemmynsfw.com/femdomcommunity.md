description: "Rules:1.) Over 18's Only. This subreddit is for persons 18 years of age or older. If you are under 18, or describe, promote, or reference, or in any way, inappropriate contact with persons under 18, your post will be removed and you will be banned. We don't give a shit if the age of consent in your country is less than that.2.) This is not a personals site. This is discussion subreddit. Please go to /r/BDSMpersonals, /r/femdompersonals, etc if you're looking to advertise for a partner or for professional services. Likewise, do not approach community members with unsolicited sexual content or offers to engage in sexual activities. Honestly, we do not take this behaviour lightly and will ban you permanently for it.3.) We're here to talk about femdom, not masturbate to it. This is a community subreddit. We want it to be a place where people can seek help and support.If you're sharing a story here it should fall into:a) An achievement/episode you want to share with the community (not with the purpose of titillating yourself or others)b) Details that help us help you when you come seeking support or advice.c) It has an educational purpose or serves to illustrate a discussion.If you're not sure your story fits, always feel free to message the mod team.4.) Do Not Presume Familiarity. If someone defines themselves as A Domme, Top, Mistress, it does not mean they are your Domme, Top, Mistress, nor does it mean they even want you to ask. Really. Just because someone is a sub does not mean they are your sub, or that you may treat them different than anyone else.5.) When discussing kink, model responsible practices.The way we talk about kink has an effect on others. When discussing kink, take care to not do so in a way that shames other people's kinks, fetishises abuse, reproduces toxic social mores or further harms marginalised groups.Likewise, take responsibility for the advice you share with the community. If you're offering specialist knowledge on practices that might incur in significant physical or psychological harm, make sure to provide credible references or detail including potential harm.6.) Help Us Help You. We get a lot of threads asking for advice, and we've got a lot of folk willing to help. Please help them by including you and your partners needs and limits. More advice on getting help can be found in the wiki.7.) Be Excellent to Each Other. This is your community. Make it a welcoming, helpful place where people can feel heard and valued. Treat others as you would like to be treated yourself. Sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, harassment, bullying, xenophobia, kink shaming and victim blaming will not be tolerated."
