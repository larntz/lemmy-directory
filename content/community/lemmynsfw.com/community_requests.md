description: "If a moderator is banned or has been inactive for a while, we can assign new moderators to the communities where they are moderating.##### The rules are simple:- If you believe that a mod is not active, create a post here with the title Requesting /c/community. Write your reasons below.- We send a message to that mod and wait for a week.- If there is no return, you will be **added to the existing moderators**.##### Why not replace?Because I do not want to destroy the efforts of the current moderator. Maybe some time later we can remove that mod too. Like 2 weeks or something."
