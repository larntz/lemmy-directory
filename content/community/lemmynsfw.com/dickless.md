description: "#### Dicklessis a community for people with penises that have sex with body parts other than their dick. There are number of communities online for Anal Only, but they mostly focus on cis women. Instead, dickless is for people with dicks (ironic, isn't it). If you have a penis, but prefer to have sex with your butt, your nipples, your mouth, or some other way, you're in the right place. Related kinks and fetishes like chastity, bdsm, etc. are welcome.Rules:- No illegal or harmful content- Don't be a dick- All posts must be tagged as NSFW- No Jerking!**Currently looking for more moderators**-**What is Dickless?**Dickless is a community for content and discussion by and about people who have a dick, and choose not to use it. Not people who don't have sex, but people that use their other erogenous zones for sex instead. Wether you prefer to use your mouth, your nipples, or your backdoor, your welcome here!**Why does this community exist?**There are many communities on the internet for people who are Anal Only, but they're either dominantly cis women, or attached to some related kink (chastity, sissy, BDSM). In all my searching, I couldn't find one that was primarily intended for people born with penises, so I'm making one!**Why would anyone not use their dick?**Because there's more to sex than that! Some people find that their other ergonous zones can be more stimulating or rewarding than their genitals. Communities for people who are Anal Only exist, usual for cis women that prefer anal sex, so it's not too far fetched to think that are are some penis-havers that feel the same! Whether it's just a fetish, or how your body or brain is wired, you don't have to use your dick if you don't want to.**You've got my attention...**If you're interested, subscribe! If you see something you like, upvote and comment! If you have a question, or some content to post, go ahead! This should be a welcoming community that supports people that prefer sex without their dicks**What should I post?**Text posts with relevant questions, experiences, or or other discussion are good, it doesn't have to just be a porn feed. Pictures, gifs, or short videos are also good. Some rules for posts- be relevant to dickless sex- no advertisements- no random porn links"
