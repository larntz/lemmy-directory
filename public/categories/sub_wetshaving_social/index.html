      1. Tag your post in the title. The approved tags are as follows:  [WTS] Want to Sell [WTB] Want to Buy [WTT] Want to Trade [WTG] Want to Give [WTS/WTT] Want to Sell or Trade [Vendor] Provider of goods and services through their own site [Service] Honing, restoration, sensual massage... [Artisan] You make your own goods by hand and you think you&#39;re fancy [Hobby] Not quite a vendor or service, but more than a casual trader  2. Provide an accurate description and pricing All sale posts must include a price but it may be negotiable. Auction style pricing will not be permitted. An accurate description of the item should be provided. Pictures of the item are highly encouraged for accuracy.  3. Be courteous and respectful adults.  4. No link only posts. Link posts or posts with just a link in the text box will be deleted. Please include some other description or information in the post.  5. Only list items you own/provide. Do not link to eBay auctions, deals you found elsewhere, sales on other forums or items that aren&#39;t yours.  6. 1 post per tag per day. There is a maximum of 3 posts per day, each must be of separate types like [WTS], [WTT] or [WTB] for example.  No more than 5 total posts of all types within a week maximum.  Vendors may post once per week.  7. Wait at least 7 days to repost items. Wait at least 7 days to repost an item. This includes deleting and reposting before 7 days.  There is a &#39;WTS Reduced&#39; flair that can be used to draw attention if you&#39;ve edited to reduce prices.  8. Update your post&#39;s flair and mark NSFW. Update the link flair on your post to NSFW once all sales/trades are final. Editing post flair should be available on all platforms.  This should be done for all [WTS], [WTT], [WTG] and even [WTB] posts. This helps keep our community clean and lets others know if items are unavailable or if someone is still looking to buy.  9. Do not delete prices or posts/comments that have sold items. Posts or comments that include sold items, along with their prices, should be left so that buyers can search item price history as well as seller reliability.  10. Use at your own risk. The moderators and administrators are not responsible for any transactions in any way.

      This is a community of enthusiasts, hobbyists and artisans who enjoy a traditional wet shave: brush, soap, and safety or straight razor. We are a part of the /r/WetShaving community found on Reddit, Discord, and IRC, and the wetshaving.social Mastodon instance.  **Community Rules**  Rule 1 - Behaviour and Etiquette  -Be Respectful. Do not bully, flame, or harass others.  -Malicious comments are not allowed but heated discussion and salty banter is okay.  -Low effort replies and complaints about content will be removed.  Rule 2 - Content Guidelines  -Mail Calls, Simple Questions, and SOTD posts belong in the recurring weekly threads.  -Posts must have sufficient content to generate a meaningful discussion.  -Images, links, or videos must include additional text that summarizes the topic.  Rule 3 - Reviews and Disclosure  -Use the &#39;First Impressions&#39; flair if your experience with the product is limited.  -Use the &#39;Review&#39; flair if you can provide comprehensive details with enough familiarity to answer follow-up questions.  -Disclose how the product being reviewed was acquired (e.g., PIF, loan, or purchase). If the product was provided to you directly by the maker or vendor free of charge or at a discount, you must disclose this fact even if the item will later be returned to the maker or vendor.  Rule 4 - Advertising  -Vendors are to keep marketing within the biweekly Deals/New Products threads.  -Non-vendors may post topics about products if it will foster a compelling discussion.  -Do not solicit donations or share fundraisers without mod approval.  Rule 5 - Inappropriate Content  -All NSFW/L content must request mod approval and be flaired appropriately.  -Non-shaving related NSFW/L content is not allowed.  Rule 10 - Moderator Discretion  -The rules may not apply perfectly to every situation. The mods have final discretion.  -Questions, concerns, or appeals must be sent through modmail. Do not message individual mods.
