      Community for general chat, suggestions, shooting the shit, etc.  Still fine to post booty pics or even memes but mostly keep it to discussion topics.  I figure this will be pretty slim but could be used for like announcements and such perhaps.  The `community` itself is marked NOT NSFW but that type of content is still allowed (as long as its legal) but be sure to mark your `post` NSFW.  **‚ö†Ô∏è See spoiler section below for a list of the NSFW communities that would otherwise be hidden if you are not logged in!!!**  ---  **Uploads**  Would prefer if you could use an image/vid host and just post that vs uploading please.  I have a dinky little server ü§°  Since imgur is banning/removing NSFW content I recommend the following:  - [RedGifs](https://www.redgifs.com/) - [Lensdump](https://lensdump.com/) - [Catbox](https://catbox.moe/)  ---  **For first timers:**  - I am still trying to figure out how federation works.  - I am noticing that it is difficult for peeps to find NSFW communities to federate to when they are coming from other instances.  - I am adding a site map here (to this non-NSFW c) to try to remedy that.  There seems to be two main ways you can `path` directly to a NSFW community in order to subscribe and federate:  - use your search feature on your main instance and enter `!{community_name}@{instance_url}` then you can subscribe  - or, from your main instance, alter your url to: `{your main instance}/c/{community_name}@{instance_url}  Below are a list of NSFW communities in this instance if you are interested (they are wrapped in a spoiler tag as they are NSFW).  **NSFW Below in Spiler** ::: spoiler spoiler  [butt_frenzy](https://booty.world/c/butt_frenzy) Pics/Gifs/Vids of butts!  `!butt_frenzy@booty.world`  [hentai_booty](https://booty.world/c/hentai_booty)  `!hentai_booty@booty.world`  [twerking](https://booty.world/c/twerking)  `!twerking@booty.world`  [sideways_booty](https://booty.world/c/sideways_booty)  `!sideways_booty@booty.world`  [hungry_butts](https://booty.world/c/hungry_butts)  `!hungry_butts@booty.world`  [pawg](https://booty.world/c/pawg)  `!pawg@booty.world`  [big_black_asses](https://booty.world/c/big_black_asses)  `!big_black_asses@booty.world`  [rice_cakes](https://booty.world/c/rice_cakes)  `!rice_cakes@booty.world`  [anal](https://booty.world/c/anal)  `!anal@booty.world`  :::  ---  **Donations**  If you would like to contribute to server costs please consider donating üôè:   [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bootybotdi3)  ---
