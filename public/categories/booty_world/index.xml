      <description>/c/General Discussion on booty.world https://booty.world/c/general
Description Community for general chat, suggestions, shooting the shit, etc. Still fine to post booty pics or even memes but mostly keep it to discussion topics.
I figure this will be pretty slim but could be used for like announcements and such perhaps.
The `community` itself is marked NOT NSFW but that type of content is still allowed (as long as its legal) but be sure to mark your `post` NSFW.</description>
