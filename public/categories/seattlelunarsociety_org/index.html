      Clean jokes (or cleaned-up jokes) that your Mom would like.    NO: - F-bombs - Heavy use of expletives - Racism - LGBTQ slurs  Humor is universal and laughter should be shared by everyone, without excluding or belittling others.    It doesn&#39;t have to be crass to be funny.  Take the high road.  Your Mom would be proud of you. :)  Dad jokes are OK here too, and you can find more of those here: https://lemmy.world/c/dadjokes
