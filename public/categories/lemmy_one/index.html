      **Welcome Rexxitors, to the new home of r/nonbinary and r/enby**  This is a space for people of all ages who feel that they don&#39;t fit into our culture&#39;s gender binary. Share stories, experiences, questions, images, art, poetry - anything to help you through the journey of expressing the real you and meeting others who are like you.  # Rules  -**No gatekeeping.** The foundation of this sub is inclusivity. Please don&#39;t judge others in their gender journey. We don&#39;t need any more obstacles to understanding ourselves.  -**No guess my AGAB or do I look nonbinary posts.** We do not allow posts that ask anyone to guess OP&#39;s AGAB/assigned gender at birth, whether it is as the main point of the post or a side-note, etc. If you see these posts, please report them to us.  -**No NSFW content.** Remember that this is an all-ages space, there are kids here.  -**Don&#39;t post hate speech, even if it was directed at you.** It&#39;s okay to ask for support after a hateful interaction, but please don&#39;t post screencaps of what was said.  -**Don&#39;t reveal personal information.** Posting anyone&#39;s phone numbers, physical/mailing addresses, email, and social media handles are all forbidden - even your own. If you want to connect with another user outside of Lemmy, message them privately.  -**No shitposting or trolling.** Keep content here relevant to nonbinary topics/experiences, and don&#39;t be purposefully inflammatory.  # Resources - [Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) - [Nonbinary Wiki](https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Main_Page) - [Dictionary of Gender Neutral Language](https://en.pronouns.page/dictionary)
