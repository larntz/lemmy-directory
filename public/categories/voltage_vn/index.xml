Description Vietnam is notoriously opaque to outsiders. This is a community where you can ask questions, and hopefully get answers.
For example, where to buy a thing, how to attend a wedding, living and working here, what food to eat, and whatever else you might want to know. Don&#39;t ask how to commit crimes though. That will get you banned.

Description This is a place for people residing in Vietnam to discuss technology -- because sometimes the local optimum for a problem is a little bit different here.
No ads, political content, NSFW, and so on. Be helpful, kind, and patient. Details * Subscribers 2 Posts 1 Comments 0 Daily Active Users 1 Weekly Active Users 1 Monthly Active Users 1 Published 2023-06-14 09:14:51 Updated 1969-12-31 19:00:00 Last Scraped 2023-06-16 11:06:27 </description>
