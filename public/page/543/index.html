      #### Dickless is a community for people with penises that have sex with body parts other than their dick.   There are number of communities online for Anal Only, but they mostly focus on cis women. Instead, dickless is for people with dicks (ironic, isn&#39;t it). If you have a penis, but prefer to have sex with your butt, your nipples, your mouth, or some other way, you&#39;re in the right place. Related kinks and fetishes like chastity, bdsm, etc. are welcome.  Rules: - No illegal or harmful content - Don&#39;t be a dick - All posts must be tagged as NSFW - No Jerking!  **Currently looking for more moderators**-    **What is Dickless?**  Dickless is a community for content and discussion by and about people who have a dick, and choose not to use it. Not people who don&#39;t have sex, but people that use their other erogenous zones for sex instead. Wether you prefer to use your mouth, your nipples, or your backdoor, your welcome here!  **Why does this community exist?**  There are many communities on the internet for people who are Anal Only, but they&#39;re either dominantly cis women, or attached to some related kink (chastity, sissy, BDSM). In all my searching, I couldn&#39;t find one that was primarily intended for people born with penises, so I&#39;m making one!  **Why would anyone not use their dick?**  Because there&#39;s more to sex than that! Some people find that their other ergonous zones can be more stimulating or rewarding than their genitals. Communities for people who are Anal Only exist, usual for cis women that prefer anal sex, so it&#39;s not too far fetched to think that are are some penis-havers that feel the same! Whether it&#39;s just a fetish, or how your body or brain is wired, you don&#39;t have to use your dick if you don&#39;t want to.   **You&#39;ve got my attention...**  If you&#39;re interested, subscribe! If you see something you like, upvote and comment! If you have a question, or some content to post, go ahead! This should be a welcoming community that supports people that prefer sex without their dicks  **What should I post?** Text posts with relevant questions, experiences, or or other discussion are good, it doesn&#39;t have to just be a porn feed. Pictures, gifs, or short videos are also good.   Some rules for posts - be relevant to dickless sex - no advertisements - no random porn links

      DirtyRoleplay is a community for finding partners for all your NSFW roleplay needs. An 18&#43; community, you&#39;re welcome to stop in, find a partner, and have fun!  **Sister Communities** - [!dirtypenpals](https://lemmynsfw.com/c/dirtypenpals) - while DirtyPenPals focuses on written word and erotic conversation, DirtyRoleplay focuses less on erotica/world crafting/etc and more on simply finding partners for those naughty roleplays, chats, etc.  **Rules** 1. **Lemmy NSFW rules come first**. Follow the global rules and you&#39;re well on your way to success. 2. **No contact info in titles**. Contact information should be in the body of your post, and you are welcome to request direct messaging to share contact information. 3. **Avoid low-quality posts**. Try to put at least a little thought into what you&#39;re looking for and wanting to offer. The bar will be pretty low for this. 4. **Title format**. Please try to format titles using the [X4Y] system, where you have [X4Y] somewhere in your title, replacing X with the gender/sexuality you&#39;re wanting to play, and Y with the gender/sexuality in your desired partner. Use the following basic tags (feel free to use other tags if these don&#39;t cover your needs):   - M: male   - F: female   - T: transsexual   - GM/DM: gamemaster/dungeon Master   - NB: non-binary 5. **Strictly 18&#43;**. This is already a global rule, but especially enforced here. All posts must clearly imply that all characters, whether real or not, must be 18&#43;/legal adults. Any post as much as hinting at anything else will be removed. This community has a zero tolerance policy for this behaviour. 6. **Be civil**. Hate will not be tolerated. This community is inclusive and a safe space for all. 7. **No commercial use/promotion**. This community is *not* a community for posting ads for OnlyFans, PayPal, CashApp, or anything similar. All posts must be for consentual chat partners. Please message @myaltaccount with any account that requires payment. This does not mean that financial domination *themes* are banned - requiring payment to *chat* is banned.  Feel free to send @myaltaccount any tips, complaints, and suggestions related to this community.
