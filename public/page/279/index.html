      A community dedicated to discussing old news rather than new news.  # Rules * Keep it old: News articles should be ones you saw *at least* a week ago, that are still on the back of your mind. * Keep it local: If you are not from Madagascar and are not impacted by Madagascar, **don&#39;t** post about Madagascar. * Keep it personal: Post things you actually care about and that you have an informed opinion on. * Discuss! All threads should make full use of the lemmy&#39;s text&#43;link capability to explain why the article is still on your mind after a week or more. Textless posts are liable for removal.

      **NOTE**: Unofficial lemmy community.  A Lemmy community for Not Just Bikes, a video series about life in Amsterdam, and why Dutch cities are so great. It&#39;s not just bikes.  Rules:   1. **Be Nice.** It&#39;s the internet, but be nice. And report trolls &amp; spammers.  2. **No memes.** No memes, image macros, or low-effort posts. These are easily upvoted, but they pollute the subreddit very quickly. POSTING MEMES WILL RESULT IN A TEMPORARY BAN.  3. **Stay on topic.** Try to stick to posts and comments related to the themes of NJB videos, or content creation. Things like urban planning, mobility &amp; transportation, social equity, Dutch culture, etc..  4. **No trolling** Go troll somewhere else. We don&#39;t need that shit here.  5. **No comment screenshots** We have no patience for advocates of vehicular cycling. You can talk about vehicular cycling, but if you promote it as an alternative to safe bike infrastructure, we will ban you. You can post that crap somewhere else.  6. **No people being hit by cars / road violence** Do not show videos or pictures of people being hit by cars, or other road violence. We don&#39;t need to see that shit. We know cars are dangerous, and many people have bad memories of car crashes. Keep it out of this subreddit.  7. **No tone policing** We don&#39;t need any more tone police. If you don&#39;t like the tone that Not Just Bike takes in his videos, there&#39;s a very easy solution: stop watching them.  8. **No Internet drama** Don&#39;t spread or promote drama over what has happened on the Internet. You&#39;re spending too much time online: go touch grass.

      A lemmy community for offroad enthusiasts  Rules: 1. Let&#39;s be nice. Let&#39;s especially avoid the brand-bashing. For example, let&#39;s avoid 4x4s vs. adventure bike, Ford vs. Chevy type discussions. 2. Please don&#39;t use this community as a place to sell whatever new off-road product your company makes. Instead, please use this community as a place to share your off-road experiences, ideas, knowledge, plans, etc.

      osu! is a rhythm game based on the gameplay of a variety of popular commercial rhythm games such as Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan and Elite Beat Agents.  ## Rules  1. Keep low relevance achievements, frequently asked questions and mapping-related requests to a minimum; 2. Refrain from creating posts with the sole intention of appealing or responding to a restriction/punishment; 3. For the first 24 hours following a tournament match, you must use the spoiler tag on all posts containing spoilers and must not spoil match results on titles.  **[r/osugame Wiki on Reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20230615110535/https://old.reddit.com/r/osugame/wiki/index)**
