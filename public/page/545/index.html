      # Welcome to Erotic Art!  A community for artwork which titillates or arouses the viewer. This is not a hentai community, there&#39;s plenty of those on here. Rather, it&#39;s for erotic or pornographic art in a non-cartoon style, whether new or old (historical paintings are welcome too). Hentai need not be disqualified, but look at what&#39;s already in here and use your best judgement.  &gt; Erotic artwork is a diverse category of visual arts that includes any artistic creation meant to elicit erotic pleasure, typically representing human nakedness as well as sexual behavior. Sexual artwork may be discovered in practically every visual media, such as sketches, engravings, movies, erotic paintings, photography, and sculptural works.   ::: spoiler Just a heads up You need to create an account or enable NSFW in your current account to view the content in this community :::  # Guide to Tags  **All posts must be tagged.**  [Soft] - No penetration, no / minimal bodily fluids  [Hard] - Any penetration or excessive bodily fluids  [Fetish] - Hopefully self-explanatory, but a non-exhaustive list: BDSM, pee, bizarre bodily proportions (disproportionate breasts, penises, etc.), futa, etc. Most of these are rare in content that would be found in this sub, but if it otherwise fits, it sits, so long as it&#39;s tagged appropriately.  Historical art is not exempt from the tagging rules. E.g. [The Dream of the Fisherman&#39;s Wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tako_to_ama_retouched.jpg) would fall under [Fetish], regardless of its historical nature.  # Rules  Follow instance-wide rules and:  - As mentioned above, stick to erotic art which is not in a cartoon style, !hentai, !rule34 and their ilk exist, so please help keep this community focused. - Yes, photography is an art form, no it is not welcome here, there&#39;s plenty of subs for that. - No gore, vore, scat or anything that would be considered very extreme. - Corollary to the above rule: Rape is allowed, as to disallow it would also disallow a lot of historical paintings which outright hang in museums. **However,** the artistic merit of such will be judged much more harshly, in a manner proportionate to how graphic it is. Tag-wise, any non-historical examples likely fall under [Fetish], though feel free to ping a mod and ask for reclassification if you believe it&#39;s fine under [Hard]. - No low effort posts (low quality images/videos, black bars, etc.) - No aI generated content. If you want to post anything AI generated use the relevant communities, such as !aigen - All posts must be tagged - Loli / shota (that is, depictions of apparently underaged subjects, whether) is banned, pending an instance-wide ruling. Yes, it can be hard to tell, what one person considers loli / shota another might just consider petite, use your best judgement, and the mods will use theirs. Don&#39;t sweat it if a post gets removed, but if you&#39;re starting to become a problem, you&#39;ll get DMed / temp-banned before you get permed.  if possible please also provide the sauce (link to artist etc) in the body of your post.  I may be a bit heavy handed with moderation vis-a-vis removing things earlier on, to help set the vibe for the community, but I anticipate that will be less and less necessary over time. If your picture gets removed, don&#39;t take it as a personal slight.  If you have any suggestions or ideas for the community please feel free to message @securitas.

      For all the stuff that happens in a porn shoot and is then left on the cutting room floor  Sure, it may not all be exactly genuine, but this is a place for all the scenes behind the scenes, all the stuff that&#39;s unplanned, or things that don&#39;t make the final cut of the production but which nonetheless add quite a bit to its value

      ##### Welcome to fapdeciders. This is a channel for people looking for other people to give them directions on how to fap.  **How it works**  Make a post here on the subreddit. Post ought include the following information:  gender you identify as - sexual orientation - toys on hand - any physical limitations (i.e. can not be on knees for extended periods of time) - preferences/fantasies - what you don&#39;t like/wouldn&#39;t be into - time limit/availability (please be aware that if you only have an hour or so, you&#39;re not likely to see much attention to your post) - Posts now require post flair, denoting what you&#39;re looking for.  In your post title, please include an x4x designation (e.g., m4f, nb4a). We may start filtering out posts that do not include this in the near future.  For the most part, posters on this subreddit do not need to be verified. That said, there are now several ways that users can get verified:  - A user may post (or pm the mods) a gonewild-style verification picture, and we will grant you the flair of your choice. - A person may message the mod team on another user&#39;s behalf telling us that someone is fun to play with (either giving or receiving commands), and we will give that person an appropriate flair after confirming that that uses wants it. - Last, if you make an extreme post that we think might be fake we reserve the right to ask you to verify. If you do not, we might remove your post/and or ban you... This primarily affects destroy my life and deny me forever posts. After you post  Your post constitutes a promise that you will follow instructions to the letter (or find the closest possible substitute). Sessions should respect your limits, so please communicate them clearly both before and during.  Nitty-Gritty  - This is NOT a version of GW. Some people may be willing to post pictures, some may not. Please no comments that simply say, show us your tits. Take that shit elsewhere. - Respect all posters. No means no, unless in the context of your scene it might mean yes. In which case, there had better be a safe word in place that will actually mean no. Play safely and have a great fap!! :)
