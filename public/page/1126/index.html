      RimWorld colonies can look awesome, awful, impressive, dull, overwhelming, lame, stunning, boring, intriguing, uninteresting, legendary, whatever. If you have a nice hi-res image of a RimWorld colony that you&#39;d like to share with the Rim, feel free to post it here! If you were invited to post or are in doubt about posting, read below (about in app). Please note: a screenshot is not hi-res &amp;amp; will be removed. For instructions and more information please  read below / about before posting!  Welcome, no invite required! Everybody is free to post on RimWorldPorn! If you were asked to post here, there is no need to mention this in the title, so please avoid using titles as &#39;I was told to post this here&#39;. Instead, please provide some info about the colony in the title, like the name, amount of colonists, difficulty etc. If you&#39;ve already posted somewhere else, it is allowed to cross-post, although a new post is preferred. Feel free to join our discord as well!  If you&#39;re unsure about posting Everybody plays RimWorld in their own way. That&#39;s absolutely fine, the game is designed for that. It&#39;s your colony, if you like it, that makes it good enough to be posted here! So go for it and don&#39;t feel like maybe you should put something in your title like &#39;not as good as the others&#39;, because they simply are not better. They&#39;re just different, which is good. Most members of this community enjoy looking at how other players use their own style, layout, pawns, mods (if any) and so on. Looking at your colony can inspire others. A modlist in the comments is always appreciated!  Guide  A posted colony image must include a very large part of it&#39;s surrounding map. Some cropping is allowed, but not too much. Zooming in is part of the fun.  To make a hi-res jpg, you can use the progress renderer mod (GitHub).  This mod will automatically make renders, and by pressing 9 you can make one on demand, which will be in the manually folder. Note: zooming out too far will cause colonists not to be rendered!  Making the render suitable for posting:  Once you have the mod working, you can change its settings (like scaling) via options, mod settings. Click here for tips. Make sure you get this right, pictures with low resolution or quality will be removed. Check the quality section below for more info. Use .jpg, other formats will give too big files to post ([todo]B max)  Posting the image on reddit:  Make sure you&#39;re logged in, [todo], [todo] and upload your render.   [Flair?]After posting make sure you select the appropriate flair. If you like add a description and a modlist to the comments.  If the file is too big to post on lemmy  Do not reduce resolution / crop to reduce file size unless there is no alternative. Make sure you are using a .JPG, other formats won&#39;t work. Open the image in paint.net (windows) or Gimp, and save it as a .jpg. Both programs give you the option to alter the quality and give you a preview of the filesize. Make sure you stay as close as possible to, but below [todo]MB.  [relevant?]linking to an image on imgur:  Although linking directly to imgur images is allowed, we recommend directly uploading to Lemmy as imgur reduces the resolution to 5000x5000 and seems to lower the quality of the final image, what a waste! Imgur links must always end with .jpg. If it doesn&#39;t, you are likely linking to an album, which is not allowed. To get the correct link, in your browser right click on the image and select &#39;copy image address/location&#39; or &#39;copy link&#39;. The link will then be in your clipboard and you should now be able to paste it. Double check if it ends with .jpg!  Making a perfect image  If you want your colony to really shine, follow the tips but set encoding to PNG and Pixels per cell to 40. Then open the PNG with an image editing program that can show you the file size when saving as a JPG, like paint.net or gimp. Get it as close to 19.9 as possible, stay below 20. This should give you a very nice JPG to upload.  Colony Quality Any colony may be posted here. There is no such thing as a low quality colony. If you like your colony, so will we. Here&#39;s some tips for the renderer settings.  Image Quality Posted images have to be high resolution. The image has to look sharp when fully zoomed in, at least as far as you can zoom in in the game itself. Check the file&#39;s size. If it is under 2MB you can assume it is too low quality. Somewhere between 3-19.9MB should be ok, the bigger, the better. (The limit is 20MB on Reddit, however). Large/busy/colourful colonies can generate large files, if you have to lower the quality because of that so be it, but stay as close to 20MB as possible.
