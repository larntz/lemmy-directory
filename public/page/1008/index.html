      dormi.zone community for warframe memes and fluff posts.  Got a question for the /c/memeframe mods? [Send a message!](/u/memeframe_mods@dormi.zone)  ### Strike System  We use a 3 strike system. **Strikes are given for breaking the Golden Rule, Excessive Trolling Rule, repeated failure to credit artwork, or for continued spam after a warning.** Upon the third strike, the offending user is banned from accessing dormi.zone.  **Extreme offenses, including but not limited to wishing death on another user or extreme bigotry will result in an instant permanent ban from dormi.zone.**  ### Rules on dormi.zone  The following rules apply to users registered on dormi.zone, as well as users from instances federated with dormi.zone who interact with our users and communities.  #### Posts, Comments &amp; Private Messages  These rules apply to posts and comments within dormi.zone communities, as well as private messages that include users registered on dormi.zone.  ##### Golden Rule  Do not be rude, condescending, hateful, or discriminatory.  ##### Excessive Trolling Rule  Do not intentionally mislead or antagonize others or act contrarian.  ##### Prohibited Content  Do not post any of the following:  - pornographic content. - sexual or suggestive content involving minors or individuals appearing as such. - content that encourages or incites (real-life) violence. - content that conducts or encourages threats, harassment or bullying - another person&#39;s personal or confidential information - content that impersonates another person in a misleading or deceptive manner  Violating this rule will result in an instant ban from dormi.zone.  ##### Ban Evasion Rule  Do not create an account to evade punishment or avoid restrictions.  #### Posts &amp; Comments  These rules apply to posts and comments within dormi.zone communities.  ##### Accusation Rule  You may only accuse another person&#39;s or organization&#39;s integrity, business practices, etc. if you have sufficient evidence.  ##### Begging Rule  Do not beg for in-game items.  ##### Link Obfuscation Rule  Do not obfuscate links using link shorteners like bit.ly.  ##### Naming Rule  You must obscure other person&#39;s names or usernames in your posts and comments.  ##### Real World Controversy  Do not introduce politics or other real-world controvery in your posts and comments.  ##### Spoiler Formatting  When the sidebar of a community states that Spoiler Formatting is being enforced, the following rules apply for posts that involve lore/story spoilers:  - You must begin the title of your spoiler post with [Spoiler] and not include the actual spoiler in the title. - Comments containing spoilers outside of spoiler posts must be formatted as a spoiler block, [see here](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/users/02-media.html).  #### Posts only  These rules apply only to posts within dormi.zone communities.  ##### Context Rule  Posts with vague or no context or with little-to-no information are removed.  ##### Expired Event Rule  Event posts are removed after the event (alert, invasion, etc.) is over.  ##### Fluff Post Quality Rule  *Meme posts must be-* nah just kidding.
