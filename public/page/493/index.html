      I review media for fun.  [My Excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DJjPbXTXUgheo-EWkwAXN61QNizpExftjTRIBGGtQU/edit?usp=sharing).  [My RYM](https://rateyourmusic.com/~gon555551).  [My Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/gon555551/), which I barely use.

      A place for all lovers of nail polish! All Reddit refugees from r/Redditlaqueristas, r/nails, r/malepolish, and similar communities welcome! I am new to moderating so please bear with me. If anyone with moderating experience would like to help shape this community, please let me know! I would welcome the help! I am just hoping to recreate a similar community to my favorite subreddit.

      #### Force is justified only by the violation of natural rights.  ---  ## Purpose  This forum is dedicated to the rational discussion of political philosophy, systems of political economy, history, and current events from the perspective of the guiding principle defined above. The principled simplification and reduction of the law can only be achieved by civil argument for this ideal. We libertarians welcome those who do not share this axiom into this forum for the purposes of civil debate and exchange of worldview.  ## Moderation  This forum is private property. It is focused on the rational discussion of a limited subset of political philosophy and its application. Members of this community will strive to preserve a forum in which on-topic discussion can be held with respect and objectivity.  Users may be permanently banned, without warning and at the sole discretion of any moderator, for repeatedly violating the rules or for circumventing moderation, including the use of alternate accounts regardless of federation. Posts, comments, and media attachments (collectively, the content) will be removed, without warning and at the sole discretion of any moderator, for violating any of the following rules.  #### Rule 1: Legality and Site Administration  The content is prohibited under the lawful jurisdiction of its geographic location or was removed or requested to be removed by any administrator of Lemmy.world.   #### Rule 2: Spam  The content is (or is associated with a pattern of content which is) deemed abusive of site features or intended to distract, hinder, or otherwise harm users during normal use of the platform.  #### Rule 3: Relevance  The content is deemed irrelevant to the discussion of libertarianism as defined by the Purpose section of the sidebar. This is quite subjective. Users will be given the benefit of the doubt and warned before any ban is issued under this section.   1. **Criticism of libertarian ideas** is relevant and vital to this forum and will not be removed under this rule.  2. **Criticism of individuals or organizations loosely associated with libertarians or libertarianism** is likely irrelevant. Association and/or self-identification are not enough to establish relevance.  Further discussion of this point is encouraged. It&#39;s vital that we develop more objective standards. This will take time.  ---  #### A Note of Context  The moderators of this community do not believe that libertarianism is an inherently right or left-wing ideology. We believe that the veneration of natural (or unalienable) rights must take priority over allegiance to systems of political economy. With that said, this platform (that is, the Lemmy software and wide distribution of instances, not necessarily Lemmy.world) has unambiguously left-wing origins. We anticipate much drama and misunderstanding about the purpose of the forum. We believe that this may be a good thing in the long run: if we uphold a high standard of discourse, this forum may become a useful tool in the defense of liberty.  &gt; Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it.   *~ Thomas Paine*  ---  *Banner photograph by [Kit Suman](https://unsplash.com/photos/Waz4K1fHzCA), modified and used under the [Unsplash License](https://unsplash.com/license)*

      A community for enthusiasts and collectors of physical video games, dedicated to announcements and discussion of limited print games and the companies that produce them.  This will likely never grow beyond being a small, niche community, but please follow just a few simple rules:  1. Be civil. Limited print game companies haven&#39;t always been the best at communicating, delivering on promises, and shipping in a timely fashion. So any community dedicated to them is sure to have some frustrated members. It&#39;s ok to express that frustration when appropriate, but please be civil about it and remember that venting isn&#39;t the purpose of this community.  2. Be kind. Disagreements are normal and it&#39;s ok to debate. But please be respectful to each other.  3. Limited print only. It&#39;s not a problem for discussion to veer into the world of wide-release games, but please limit all new posts to topics regarding limited print games/companies only.  4. No piracy. Purchasing limited print games supports developers and publishers, many of whom are very small. Absolutely NO discussion of, or links to, anything piracy-related is permitted.
