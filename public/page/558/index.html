      A community for NSFW photographers to post their work and talk about their trade. All genders and presentations welcome.  **RULES**  1) Original content (OC) only. Only post your own work. You must be the photographer! It&#39;s fine if you&#39;re also the model.   - 1a) Be prepared to prove what you post is your own, like the RAW (or original JPG) file with intact EXIF or a psd with your layers visible.  - 1b) No screencaps or other low-effort posts, only composed, deliberate photographs. If you&#39;re posting a still from your webcam, it better be really really damn good.   2) Photography only. No AI art! No work that may have started as a photograph but is now mostly AI art! Images that rely heavily on AI backgrounds (like greenscreen images) may be allowed on a case-by-case basis, but are mostly discouraged. Use of AI tools like AI skin smoothing or AI upscaling is allowed unless it&#39;s extreme.  - 2a) Composites are fine if the elements of the composite are all your own work.   3)  No advertising! That means no links to OF/Patreon/Fansly/smugmug or any other site in which anyone collects money for anything. Don&#39;t put it in your post and not in the comments to your post. If you have a link in your profile, that&#39;s fine.   - 3a) If you have some kind of nonprofit solicitation, like a charity drive for the Free Speech Coalition or something, check with mods first.  4) Flag your posts NSFW unless they aren&#39;t.   5) Text posts are fine as long as they are on-topic and tagged [Text].  - 5a) Use [Gallery] for any post that contains more than one or two images. Gallery posts are generally discouraged and if you do it too often we&#39;ll ask you to stop. Links in a comment to galleries hosted elsewhere are fine.   6) Requred imagepost level tags: [Lewd], [Nude], [Explicit], [Hardcore]   - 6a) [Nude] includes toplessness (visible nipples) **OF ANY GENDER.** The mods don&#39;t want to be in the business of figuring out what counts as NSFW nipples and what doesn&#39;t, so any visible nipple **OF ANY GENDER** should be flagged [Nude].   - 6b) [Explicit] includes any open leg, any buttholes on display, and any erect penises.   - 6c) [Hardcore] includes any sexual activity of any kind, including masturbation, ejaculation, or any explicit sexual activity between two or more people.   - 6d) When in doubt, go for the higher level. If posting multiple images of multiple levels, tag with the highest level.  7) **No images of anyone &lt;18 years old of any kind**, even if they happen to be SFW and completely innocent in nature. None. **No discussions of such images** either. If there&#39;s one rule that will get you immediately shitcanned if you break it, it&#39;s this one.   - 7a) Any posts containing unconventional fetishes (including but not limited to scat, hot lunch, blood, violent play, CNC, vore) must be tagged in the post title. If in doubt, tag it.  - 7b) Furry stuff is okay, I guess, as long as it conforms with all the other rules. No bestiality content.   8) Be nice. If you can&#39;t be nice, keep it to yourself.  - 8a) No body shaming of any kind, no homophobia, transphobia, kink shaming, or nazi shit. If there are two rules that will get you immediately shitcanned if you break them, it&#39;s 7) and this one. Mods are woke and queer and angry.   9) If you want critiques or need technical help, indicate that in your post subject and then post any relevant information in a top-level comment. This includes stuff like your camera, exposure, aperture, iso, lighting, and the intent of your image.  - 9a) A request for a critique is not a license to be a dbag. Keep your criticism constructive, please. Do not offer unsolicited critiques. If you really really really feel like you have something critical to say, you can ask if someone wants a critique in a post comment. No reply means no.  - 9b) If you ask for a critique and you get one, please take the time to reply and thank the person for their time. Also, don&#39;t get salty about critiques you don&#39;t like. You literally asked for it.

      **Not Safe For Worldbuilding:**   World building is the art of constructing a cohesive world, creating rules, writing histories, and exploring the people and societies that populate these worlds.    This community is dedicated to the less safe for work aspects of this idea. This is for discussing aspects of worldbuilding which would be inappropriate for the regular worldbuilding community.  The biology of a succubus, a planet where everyone is naked all the time, technologically enhanced sex organs. Things that would cross the line elsewhere are fair game here.   **Rules:**   * Follow the Rules of this instance.   * Posts must be worldbuilding related. This is a worldbuilding community, not a porn lemmy.   * Don&#39;t post anything illegal.   * Don&#39;t be rude.   * Flair all posts appropriately. as Lemmy does not currently have support for this, tagging them would be the best course of action  * `Example:   * Try to stay open-minded. The downvote button is not an I don&#39;t like this button.   * Have fun!  **Flairs and Their Meanings:**  * OC: If you made it, use this tag.      * Meta: For talking about the community, or worldbuilding in general. Asking for tips, discussing trends, posts about the community, all of this is fine under this tag. If you are asking users about their worlds, use the Prompt tag instead.     * Prompt: Asking users questions about their worlds. Feel free to post your own lore in the comments.      * Extreme: If it contains gore, scat, or any of the other extreme fetishes, use this tag. Posting it is fine, but let&#39;s try not to shock anyone unnecessarily. (Content involving real people is NOT ALLOWED under this tag)      * Map: Maps of your world      * Artwork: Drawings, or appropriately used photographs (taken and used with consent, not depicting illegal or Extreme content), note to give context within the body of the post or in a follow up comment, just like in regular r/Worldbuilding  Originally  [r/NSFWworldbuilding](https://old.reddit.com/r/NSFWworldbuilding/)
