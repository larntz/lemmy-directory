      1Inch is a network that connects multiple decentralized exchanges (DEX) into one unified platform. 1Inch exchange allows users to compare and optimize their crypto trades and swaps without going through every exchange separately.   The platform is unique because 1Inch splits the order and uses APIs to find the best possible route for a token swap. This way, the 1Inch protocol aims to offer the best possible rates to users. An API (application program interface) is a collection of protocols and software-building applications.   Providing security and lowering gas fees are among the main objectives of the 1Inch network.   [Whitepaper](https://mooniswap.exchange/docs/MooniswapWhitePaper-v1.0.pdf)  [Website](https://1inch.io/)

      An airdrop is an unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses. Airdrops are often associated with the launch of a new cryptocurrency or a DeFi protocol, primarily as a way of gaining attention and new followers.

      Arbitrum is a L2 solution which utilizes a technology known as optimistic rollup.  This enables Ethereum smart contracts to scale by passing messages between smart contracts on the Ethereum primary chain and Arbitrum’s L2 chain, with the bulk of transaction processing completed on the L2 chain. What this enables essentially is a dramatically improved performance in terms of speed and efficiency.   There are 3 main components in the Arbitrum system — (i) the compiler, (ii) the EthBridge, and (iii) validators. These 3 components work in sync to enable Arbitrum to be fast and interoperable.

      Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.  **WARNING:** Investing in NFTs, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and these links and discussions are not recommendations by Exploding Heads or the writer to invest in NFTs, cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

      Curve uses multiple cryptocurrencies to operate an automated market making service focused on stablecoins (cryptocurrencies programmed to mimic other assets).   Curve (CRV) is an Ethereum token that powers Curve.fi. The protocol is designed to make it easy to swap between ERC-20 tokens, such as stablecoins (like USDC and DAI) and Ethereum-based Bitcoin tokens (like WBTC and renBTC).   Most of the protocol’s liquidity pools are made up of similar assets.  The CRV token can be locked for various periods of time (up to 4 years) in order to vote on governance and claim protocol fees as a reward.

      Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is an alternative to traditional financial services. More specifically, DeFi consists of smart contracts, which, in turn, power decentralized applications (DApps) and protocols.   Many of the initial DeFi applications were built on Ethereum, and the majority of the ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) remains concentrated there.   Here are some of the ways people are engaging with DeFi today:  - Lending: Lend out your crypto and earn interest and rewards every minute - not once per month. - Getting a loan: Obtain a loan instantly without filling in paperwork, including extremely short-term “flash loans” that traditional financial institutions don’t offer. - Trading: Make peer-to-peer trades of certain crypto assets — as if you could buy and sell stocks without any kind of brokerage. - Saving for the future: Put some of your crypto into savings account alternatives and earn better interest rates than you’d typically get from a bank.  - Buying derivatives: Make long or short bets on certain assets. Think of these as the crypto version of stock options or futures contracts.   **WARNING:** Investing in NFTs, cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and these links and discussions are not recommendations by Exploding Heads or the writer to invest in NFTs, cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.
