      Post your fantasies, your fetishes, and the sexual scenarios you get a thrill from imagining, whether they are grounded in reality or defy the laws of physics.

Affiliated kbin.social magazine: https://kbin.social/m/fantasies  Don&#39;t post anything that would get the community banned, and have some level of respect for others&#39; fantasies.
