      **Welcome to the place to learn the German Language!** Come here to discuss topics or quirks related to  the German language, ask any questions about learning German, provide tips to current learners, and share your journey through the German-learning process!  **RULES**  - Make sure anything you plan on asking has not already been answered.   - No harassing someone over their level of the language of German. Everyone starts somewhere.  -  No harassing period actually. Obviously no bigotry falls under this category.  - In general, no low effort posts or spam. If you ask a question and it didn&#39;t receive much engagement, don&#39;t go on to ask it again immediately, at the least remove the original copy.  - No NSFW. This rule has its loose limits and some exceptions (i.e. commenting on German dirty talk and whatnot is alright).  - Mods are the interpreters of these rules, and have jurisdiction over other cases where a rule isn&#39;t explicitly mentioned here, but it is a common sense rule.   - This community is largely for English speakers learning/discussing German. Other languages aren&#39;t outright banned yet, but expect minimal support. If other communities arise for German help in other languages, then those languages will be barred from this community in favor of the new one.

I am simply here to spread the word of anime to the less fortunate. I think astrophysics and anime go hand in hand, like a sword and shield. Like man and woman, as G-d Himself intended for all of us when he went on that drunken bender 6000 years ago today. You don&#39;t think that fucker wasn&#39;t watching hentai? We&#39;re like his 2D, you ever think of that? Like, he&#39;s in something more than 3D, so we&#39;re like his 2D, like I just fucking said!! And he could still get it up and bust all kind of holy nuts up in them virgin guts on St. Patrick&#39;s Day way back when. That&#39;s like jerkin&#39; it to Yoko Littner. Am I really so different, G-d!?! Why the fuck have you forsaken me? You know he didn&#39;t even pay child support for Jesus, not even once? Fuckin&#39; piece of shit. Informer You know say Daddy Snow me, I&#39;m gonna blame A licky boom-boom down &#39;Tective man says Daddy Snow stabbed someone down the lane A licky boom-boom down InformerI disagree with that in general. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ಠ_ಠLegislated mandates in sentencing can create some awful tyrannies. I think we need a human dimension to sentencing because I believe that leads, overall, to more humane and constructive corrective value. As long as there is some oversight watching out for unreasonable abusers and a channel to deal with tha t, then I think we are better off in the long run. The law can&#39;t anticipate or solve every problem in advance and trying to design it to be that way would make it too unwieldy, burdensome, and in some cases potentially wildly inhumane. Three strikes laws are examples of such failure in the past.

It&#39;s good, but it suffers from some mediocre tricks of convenience that are really annoying. It&#39;s pretty unique, except for the pretty predictable ending. However, the last episode ties things together well enough that I can forgive it for that.

Each episode is kind of dumb and strings you along with info you couldn&#39;t possibly know. Lots of exposition. The only reason I&#39;m saying eh is the ending ties stuff together decently and is emotionally effective. I also liked how almost every episode had a large time jump. There&#39;s also a cool implementation of how the internet could be in the future. It just sucked. Perhaps 4th worst show I&#39;ve ever seen.

[repeat] [MC Shan:] Me sitting round cool with my dibby dibby girl Police kDetroit Metal City Some say this is There are a couple viable explanations that I have mused about. The first one is the most obvious... Namely that humanity survived into the future without help the first time through... Perhaps just barely. Perhaps only after great loss and long eras of suffering. In this scenario there is no paradox. Why would the future survivors care to reach back in time and aid their struggling ancestors? These humans were apparently masters of time. Maybe from their perspectPeople seem to be overlooking the deviations from the biblical story as sort of random ignorance on the part of the filmakers. But I think these deviations are coherently intentional ... Scott&#39;s take on this film seems to have been to cast the plague miracles pretty much as if they were coincidental natural events. And Moses&#39; conversations with God were hallucinatory episodes triggered by a head injury. These hard to believe events culminated in a rebellion by the Hebrews and provoked the one remarkable event that is hard to deny historically: namely, Ramses allowing the Hebrews to leave Egypt. Perhaps Ridley Scott is saying, in essence, Eventually the story of the Exodus got turned into a miraculous mythology. But here, dear viewer, is a plausible rendering of how it all may have really happened.ive of being able to see through all of time, everyone to them is in the present (as was apparent in the tesseract construct). Perhaps they chose to reach back in time to render aid to fellow humans out of compassion, to save a lot of lives -- much as we might render aid to less fortunate people today.the Metalocalypse of anime. It&#39;s not. They go in the opposite direction. DMC is about a kid moving to Toky who wanted to be an indie pop act, but for some unexplained reason wound up in a death metal band that he hates. And the comedy comes from him stumbling into situations that are way over his head. He&#39;s touted as a metal god who mostly lives up to the reputation by accident. It&#39;s sometimes really funny. It was obviously cheaplyYour accusations here are way overblown. Your assertion that there is some sort of quality judgement about one music style over another (akin to racism as you imply above) is just not there. She simply chose a music style that she knew that he did not enjoy. That was the point of the message. You should not force other people to listen to your music because they might not enjoy doing so. Comparing this to Guantanamo torture is just way off base. Gross overstep? Hardly! Finally, there&#39;s no way he would have to sit and listen to the music for 20 hours straight. He was probably given several sessions to attend... probably something like 5 days in a row for 4 hours each. You just need to wind down a bit and take a look at this again in a couple days. Maybe you&#39;re going through finals and are really stressed out or something? made, because they only animate the part of the screen where things are happening. Sometimes, most of the screen is totally black. And each episode is only ~14 minutes, including a 1.5 minute OP, and most episodes are split into two stories. So the pace is blinding. It doesn&#39;t have a real ending. He defeats the king of American death metal, inherits his true kvlt guitar, and then plays his silly indie songs with it on the street.
