No spam or reposts &#43; limit off topic comments.**&gt;Pro-Epic comments will not mean a ban. Discussion is healthy.&gt;&gt;However, spamming posts will be removed. Reposts will be removed with the exception of a repost becoming the main hub for discussion on that topic.&gt;&gt;Off topic comments that do not pertain to the post at hand may be removed if it is deemed they contribute nothing and/or foster hostility at users. This mostly applies to political and religious debate, but can be applied to other things at the mod&#39;s discretion.**5.

Stay civil and there won&#39;t be problems.**7. Do not ask for Epic Games support.**&gt;This sub is called Fuck Epic. Most visitors here either don&#39;t use Epic store or are already done with it. Therefore, do not ask for or comment providing Epic Games support at any capacity. If a post complains about how bad the Epic launcher or support is, you are allowed to give advice on how to delete their account.&gt;&gt;If you need help either contact the official Epic Games support or ask your question here: [r/EpicGamesPC](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC)**8. No Advertising for Epic Games / Store**&gt;Under no circumstance are you allowed to promote or advertise any product or service for Epic Games or the EGS in any way. This includes posting a link to a game page; instead create a discussion where you or some article gives the details of the exclusivity.**9. Flair your posts correctly**&gt;Please flair your post correctly, this is to ensure visitors can use the Filter by Flair option in the sidebar to look for specific topics.&gt;&gt;If you don&#39;t know what flair to use or how to set them up [refer to our wiki here](https://archive.is/3Xqm7).&gt;&gt;Posts will be temporarily removed until properly flaired, send us a mod mail with a link and we will approve it.**10. No factually misleading information**&gt;Content that makes claims or implications about Epic that can be proven false or misleading will be removed.&gt;&gt;If instead it&#39;s most probably user error e.g. my Epic account got hacked then it will likely be removed as it&#39;s misleading you into thinking it&#39;s Epic&#39;s fault when the user didn&#39;t secure their account properly.&gt;&gt;Exceptions may be made for useful discussion; the misleading flair will then be applied.&gt;&gt;This rule does not apply to simple opinions including pro-Epic opinions.---##Related subreddits[r/TimCriticizesTim](https://www.reddit.com/r/TimCriticizesTim)">
