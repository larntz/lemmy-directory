Be nice** Be respectful and constructive. No harassment. No grossly offensive images. No hate including racism, misogyny, transphobia, ableism, etc. **2. No spoilers** Don&#39;t post spoilers in the main title of a post. If posting a spoiler elsewhere, use the spoiler tag and identify which series and episode the spoiler is from. In an episode discussion thread, spoilers for that episode don&#39;t need to be tagged.**3. No pirated Dropout content** Don&#39;t link to â€” or request a link to â€” any Dropout content that is shared illegally. Transformative works like fan animations should be okay in most cases.**4. Stay on topic**All top-level posts to the community must reasonably relate to Dropout, a Dropout series, or a Dropout series cast member in some way.**5. No shitposts**Memes are fine, but noticeably low-quality content will be removed.:D">
