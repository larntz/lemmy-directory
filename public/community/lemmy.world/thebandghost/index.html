This is a Ghost discussion community: of course, as with any artform- there are topics that the music might bring up.

Additionally, the moderator is big, big big time into the lore and exploring the symbolism. If you aren‚Äôt, listen, it‚Äôs cool. I definitely get it, but again, just scroll on by.
