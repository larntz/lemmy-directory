With that said, this platform (that is, the Lemmy software and wide distribution of instances, not necessarily Lemmy.world) has unambiguously left-wing origins. We anticipate much drama and misunderstanding about the purpose of the forum. We believe that this may be a good thing in the long run: if we uphold a high standard of discourse, this forum may become a useful tool in the defense of liberty.&gt; Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it.  *~ Thomas Paine*---*Banner photograph by [Kit Suman](https://unsplash.com/photos/Waz4K1fHzCA), modified and used under the [Unsplash License](https://unsplash.com/license)*">
