Don&#39;t reveal the location of other usersFairly simply rule I think, considering the nature of Cellmapper we store a lot of information that is geotagged. If you have knowledge about someone that isn&#39;t public, don&#39;t be a knob and reveal it to the world unless they want to. It&#39;s just basic manners to be honest.3.
