			<meta name="description" content="## Rules**Disclaimer**These rules are copied directly from r/DnDMemes and will be adapted to Lemmy shortly.**Rule 1.** Be Excellent to One Another: No trolling, harassment, personal attacks, sea-lioning, hate speech, slurs, or name-calling. Overly off-topic, political, or hateful debates will be removed, and bans may be issued based on severity. This includes both posts and comments. We reserve the right to remove content or comments that contain discrimination or distasteful content. Be kind and stay on topic.**Rule 2.** No Reposts: Posts must not have been posted in !DnDMemes before. Reports with direct links to the original post will greatly expedite their removal process. Reposts from other subreddits are allowed, but once a meme is posted to !DnDMemes, it will forever after be considered a repost.**Rule 3.** Post Style Guide: Posts must be strongly relevant to D&amp;amp;D (or other TTRPGs) and must include an attempt at humor or entertainment. Posts must be legible, understandable for a general audience and have some effort put into them, including titles. Video posts may be up to 3 minutes long, and they must be humorous in nature. Only one meme is allowed per post; posts with multiple images inside of them, such as a collage, will be removed. Posts must not rely solely on the title to relate to D&amp;amp;D.**Rule 4.** No Advertising: Meme culture is non-profit. No links to stores, fundraising/payment sites, or comments asking for money/followers. Social media handles or website watermarks on original content are acceptable, unless these are monetized, and self promotion of oneâ€™s own social media should be limited to once per week. Accounts whose sole purpose are to push products, whether legitimately or fraudulently, will be permanently banned and their content removed.**Rule 5.** No Piracy: Do not share or request pirated content. No linking, hinting at, or naming hosts of illicit non-SRD D&amp;amp;D content. You are allowed to copy-paste relevant rules or sections from sources, but large blocks of text may be removed.**Rule 6.** No Beating a Dead Horse: Moderators may step in to issue a 3 month prohibition on certain meme topics and formats. The requirements for placing a topic on hiatus are 1. The topic has been prominent on the front page for at least 3 days or 2. The debate topic is toxic in nature. Certain historically overdone themes or formats may be retired permanently at moderator discretion/per user poll. Please see the current list.---The rules listed above are not exhaustive and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Such decisions can be appealed in mod mail, and the mods will do their best to come to a productive resolution. All borderline mod decisions are the product of informed and objective internal discussion. We welcome feedback on our rules and are always seeking to improve them for better clarity and creating a friendly, social environment here at !DnDMemes. ">
