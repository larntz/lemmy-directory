You can talk about vehicular cycling, but if you promote it as an alternative to safe bike infrastructure, I will ban you. You can post that crap somewhere else.**7.

We know cars are dangerous, and many people have bad memories of car crashes. Keep it out of this subreddit.**8. No tone policing**We don&#39;t need any more tone police. If you don&#39;t like the tone that Not Just Bike takes in his videos, there&#39;s a very easy solution: stop watching them.**9.
