(And if you don‚Äôt like antifa, we really don‚Äôt care).**2. No in-fighting.** We‚Äôre here to fight fascism, not each other. The only exception are fascists and anything adjacent to fascism. Go wild on them and report. This also means we expect you to keep discussion somewhat civil -- don&#39;t go overboard with insults when you&#39;re debating.**3. No linking to stonetoss&#39; website or social media.** This applies to comments and submissions and no exceptions will be made. Bypassing the filter with creative spelling will get you permanently banned.**4. Edit the credits in all comics.** Your edit must have credits that clearly identify it as antifa. The easy one is ‚ÄúStonetoss is a nazi‚Äù. We&#39;re lenient on this one -- keep in mind the point is to avoid having our edits shared by fascists.**5. How to provide the oregano.** If you want to explain the original comic (before the edit), please write a transcript. We don&#39;t allow the posting of original comics even with the credits removed.**6. We only allow edits from Stonetoss**, but also **original comics if you&#39;re the author** and were inspired by the subreddit ([read more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/antifastonetoss/comments/fujhsx/the_current_state_of_original_comics_on_the_sub/)). If you want to submit something else, please ask in modmail first.**7. No bigotry, trolling or fascism.** This applies to your comment history as well. No racism, sexism, ableism, classism, anti-LGBT discrimination, or any other form of bigotry. No support of fascism either. The comfort level of readers who experience these forms of bigotry takes priority in this subreddit over your right to speak freely.**8. Edits must be in support of things stonetoss hates**. Conversely, don&#39;t make edits that agree with stonetoss. Stonetoss hates many things (the LGBT, the left, religion, vegans, minorities...) so there&#39;s many topics to pick from.**9.
