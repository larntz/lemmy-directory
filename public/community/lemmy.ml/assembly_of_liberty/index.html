All commit to supporting member business/small businesses. All businesses MUST be worker co-ops, or freelancers w/ 1 employee which if you think about it is the same thing. The union would have it&#39;s own bank/credit union. The union would use money to buy real estate and investments. It&#39;d use rent (while also forcing rents lower in places) to pay for medical coverage for members. Example: Say we have a debit card for the Credit Union that charges a 5% fee for transactions, similar to a vat. Those go into a fund for medical coverage. This fund is fully transparent, all funds in/out are broadcast via an api. Members then can submit medical bills, and we pay them. If we don&#39;t have enough in our coffers, we try to work out deals w/ hospitals on your behalf for payment plans, and we pay as we can. We also hold fund raisers, etc to make up the difference. All while adding more real estate rentals, and backup funding sources, etc...We could for instance have our own cooperatively owned: Bank, Cloud Hosting (AWS/Digital Ocean), Amazon / Ebay (Marketplace of goods), Hospitals (cut down costs of services), Drug Company (mail order pharmacy &#43; generics made in-house &#43; r/d on new drugs that we offer w/out greed). Executives in all co-op owned businesses would be capped at 250k, and employees would be given stock options, bonuses, and living wages.  The premise of this is based on dual power, and I&#39;m not gonna go on and on, I highly recommend reading up on it though at: https://dsa-lsc.org/2018/12/31/dual-power-a-strategy-to-build-socialism-in-our-time/">
