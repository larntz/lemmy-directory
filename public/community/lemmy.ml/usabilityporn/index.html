Screenshots of desktops must have at least one window open. You may include a screenshot of your blank desktop if necessary as an additional image in the album.2.

No desktop/distro elitismFollowing the [r/UnixPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnixPorn) tradition, please prefix your post title with square brackets and the name of your desktop environment or window manager inside.Example: [Cinnamon] Linux Mint has been a bliss so far!## Content Ideas1. Screenshots of a unique workflow for a specific task     * ex. A desktop optimized for pen testing that has easy access to all of your tools.    * ex. A desktop that you use graphic design with an easy-to-access color picker widget and Krita opened2. Screenshots with beautiful software that ties in nice with your desktop3. Regular screenshots of your every-day setup!4. A short screencast of how you implement a given environment (DE, tilling windows manager, terminal multiplexer or even just your text editor) This idea came from [u/piotr_wonsz](https://www.reddit.com/u/piotr_wonsz)">
