Name calling or obvious trolling falls under that.    Hate cars, hate the system, but not people. While some drivers definitely deserve some hate, most of them didn&#39;t choose car-centric life out of free will.2. **No bigotry or hate.**    Racism, transphobia, misogyny, ableism, homophobia, chauvinism, fat-shaming, body-shaming, stigmatization of people experiencing homeless or substance users, etc. are not tolerated.    Don&#39;t use slurs.    You can laugh at someone&#39;s fragile masculinity without associating it with their body.    The correlation between car-culture and body weight is not an excuse for fat-shaming.3. **Stay on-topic.**    Submissions should be on-topic to the externalities of car culture in urban development and communities globally. Posting about alternatives to cars and car culture is fine.    Don&#39;t post literal car fucking.4. **No traffic violence.**    Do not post depictions of traffic violence.    NSFW or NSFL posts are not allowed.    Gawking at crashes is not allowed.    Be respectful to people who are a victim of traffic violence or otherwise traumatized by it.    News articles about crashes and statistics about traffic violence are allowed.    Glorifying traffic violence will get you banned.5. **No reposts.**    Before sharing, check if your post isn&#39;t a repost. Reposts that add something new are fine. Reposts that are sharing content from somewhere else are fine too.6. **No misinformation.**    Masks and vaccines save lives during a pandemic, climate change is real and anthropogenic - and denial of these and other established facts will get you banned.    False or highly speculative titles will get your post deleted.7. **No harassment.**    Posts that (may) cause harassment, dogpiling or brigading, intentionally or not, will be removed. Please do not post screenshots containing uncensored usernames.    Actual harassment, dogpiling or brigading is a bannable offence.Please report posts and comments that violate our rules.">
