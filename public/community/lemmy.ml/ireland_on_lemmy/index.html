Simply put, the worst part about /r/Ireland was Reddit and the direction the company was going in. So with that said, here is an alternative. A community for the island of Ireland, a place for Ireland and Irish people. I hope to enable discussion about news &amp; current events, where people can ask questions, share memes, and just for general good craic and good vibes. Memes, shitposts, questions, discussions and news are all welcome. I would ask people to not take the piss please, and if ye are going to post articles, please don&#39;t post paywalled ones. Anyway, suggestions welcome. I hope you enjoy this community.">
