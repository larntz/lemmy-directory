			<meta name="description" content="## Submission Rules#### Rule 1 - Posts Must Be Foodporn Related- As c/FoodPorn is a food photography community, all posts and comments must relate, in some way, to food photography. Any comments or posts that are hateful, rude, or antagonizing will be removed and the user may be banned at the modâ€™s discretion. Do not engage with trolls. Any gatekeeping of content that you deem unworthy can result in a removal of content and result in a ban, per the mod team&#39;s discretion.- We also will remove content that is not up to our standards as a food photography forum. Stage the food, make sure lighting is on point, make sure plating is on point. Make an effort. This is not a dumping ground for random food photos.#### Rule 2 - Only Submit Single Images and Gifs- Gif&#39;s are only allowed as long as they comply with the rules here.- Videos, collections, interactive images/websites, and articles are not allowed.#### Rule 3 - Include Context in the Title- Include some context in the title (including the name of the food, not just the type of meal e.g. lunch). All non-OC must credit the content creator in the title.- If it is your image, please place an [OC] tag in the title.- If it is non-OC, please credit the original. Posts without credits may be removed for rule breaking- Low effort titles will be removed. Please try and describe what&#39;s in your photo the best you can (e.g. Dim Sum Lunch or Antipasto with parma ham, olives, gruyere cheese, and breadsticks).#### Rule 4 - One Non-Original Post Per Day- You may only post one non-original content post per day. A non-OC post is a photograph (or gif) that you did not create yourself.#### Rule 5 - Recipes should be in plain text- We do not require posts to include a recipe, however we do strongly encourage it. If you decide to include a recipe it must be posted in plain text in the comments section. You are free to link to off-site recipes, but there must always be a plain text version in a comment, if there is to be any recipe at all.#### Rule 6 - Civil Comments only- Please remember the human and keep your comments civil.Banner Credit: https://www.flickr.com/photos/22218354%40N05/7308567546">
