Non-socialists are welcome to come to learn, though it&#39;s hard to get to in-depth discussions if the community is constantly fighting over the basics. We ask that non-socialists please be respectful and try not to turn this into a left vs right debate forum by asking leading questions or by trying to draw others into a fight.</description>
